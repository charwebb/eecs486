Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Oh! Surprise.
Yes.
Uh, I can't. Um...
I can't eat dairy.
Yeah, it makes me sick.
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
No, I... I get it. It's funny.
You're right. You're right. Yes.
I hate that.
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
No, I...I get it. It's funny.
You're right. You're right. Yes.
You're talking about my hysterectomy.
Um... what about office romance?
Wow!
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
...Jim.
Is there anybody else.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
I'll take the teapot.
Damn it.
I really want the iPod.
I'll take the oven mitt.
We can drink?
Me. Please.
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah.
Damn it.
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
All right!
Me.
Wow!
You can take my van!
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
Four and a half.
Oh, that's part of my dream too.
Slip.
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
Yeah. Wow.
Thanks.
Please don't tell a sailor joke.
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
Did you hear anything yet?
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Wow.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
Oh, right.
[shocked expression]
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
That town smells like cheese steaks.
I have a lot of work to do.
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
Oh, that's what they call it.
Hey, champagne.
Where'd you get that salad?
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
That's cool.
That was in your way?
Sorry.
[takes mug] Yes.
[raises hand] I want to.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
What was your cell like?
Yes.
Is that a threat?
No thanks. They're too sweet.
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
Gerty's.
I don't remember.
SHUT UP ANGELA!
Wait, this is the entertainment?
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
I really want to come out!
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
You ready?
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Grow up.
Get over yourself.
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
[still laughing] I know.
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
Hey
Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
I don't remember doing that.
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
My car, my rules.
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
[tires screeching] Crap.
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
[eating hot dog] What is it?
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Um, I forgot my...
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
Turn around.
Yes.
Do it!
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
At the same time.
This is weird.
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Thanks.
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
I have no idea.
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
You cracked my pelvis
You're not forgiven.
[screams]
Don't pull any plugs.
Better.
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
And a rat. Separate occasions.
Hey Michael.
Better.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Sure.
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
Oh please, Michael.
You're gonna be here a
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
There's nothing in here.
Hey... there he is.
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Three hundred and five.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
Four-oh-two.
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
I think it looks good.
Angela, what kind of music?
How am I supposed to know what that is?
I can't believe he has a second job.
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
You comin'?
Piss or get off the pot!
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
I really prefer devils food cake.
Yes!
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
Don't patronize me.
Owww!
Hi, Pam.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]
Thanks for bringing that up.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
It's a couple streets over.
Sure!  That sounds fun!
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
Pretend?  Or really make one?
Make your own [bleep]in' sandwich.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
I like her nails.
I like her fingernails.
Nothing.
Who gives a f[bleep]?
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
Am I in trouble here or something?
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Well... I'm not quitting.
Don't sign anything.
Am I getting fired?
Hey, where is the steak sauce?
I got some in my minivan somewhere.
What are we gonna do?
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
No.  Something I can blackmail her with.
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
Hey, how did it go?
Okay. [remains sitting]
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
I wish Toby was still here.
Ass...turd.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
[British accent] Hello.
It's just a van.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
Pam failed art school.
Come on.
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
Yeh, they're rich.
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!!
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
I'm all right. I'm all right.
A little better. I threw up.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
Sure.
Obviously.
You're welcome.
I am fine.
I know I drink. I like to party
I am not an alcoholic!
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
We just missed Poor Richards.
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
...Brixx's, Carmen's...
...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
Well, it must have just opened up.
Yeah... all right.
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah that's better.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
No way!  There is no way! No way!
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
I am not going in there! NO!!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
No! No! No! No! No!
NO!!!
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
I call loser!
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
Hey, has anything happened yet?
She's got mean eyes.
She is an amazing actress.
Chunky monkey.
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
How much?
Seven grand?
I gotta see that little bitch.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Awesome!
Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
Surprise!
Take a nap!
Surprise.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
She could be your soul mate.
Ok, what do you think?
Did you spit in his face?
Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
I'll take them for my kid.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
About what?
What? What's wrong with my outfit?
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Ooh, where has this guy been?
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Yeah! Man in!
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
Really?
She's gonna hate being a mom.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Uh huh.
Right...
Unless there's ribs. [leaves]
We have.
Wait. Seriously?!
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim]
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
I am so pissed at this company!
Yeah. Who said that?
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
Is there still something there?
It didn't get torn off?
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
The weekend!
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
He calls it an upper decker.
So what'd you bring us?
What else?
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
I'm a hobo.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Uh, we have. Countless times.
I don't want to say it out loud.
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
Hey, let's watch this thing.
Shh. It's on.
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.
How about a threesome?
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
No, I get it.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
Talk about vacation days!
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
I have a shirt like that in my car.
Hey, it's 5:00!
She hasn't popped yet.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Like Clooney.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
It's coming off anyway.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
What do we get if we do 'em?
Here you go.
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
I just like the way it feels.
Just relax. Okay.
This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
Okay, I was just warming it up.
It's not a big deal.
We're both girls. Who cares?
Pathetic.
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
That is something I would never do.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
[breaks into the car] I'm in.
Sack up, man.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
Yup, just a cold sore.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Because it's on my genitals, genius.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
I didn't want you it!
His ass was on that seat? All right!
Thanks, hun.
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Hel-lo!
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
What do you mean?
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
Please to meet you-
Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
Suck it Oscar.
Wow, so this building can get uglier.
Not yet!
Wow.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
That scowl.
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Thank you.
The real problem is the teachers' union.
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Annoying.
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
Sweet! Free Ring!
Why?
Maybe it wasn't.
Uh, I also don't see Andy.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Sure.
Forget you.
Fine, just give it.
That apple looks delic!
I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
You hit me with your car!
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
[quickly] Erotic.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
[looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
Tell us the freaking story!
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Yeah, you gotta know.
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
People in the other group.
Hey!
���Suck it losers.���
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
Hey, this ain't no Breakfast Club, bitch.
I gotta go.
Hi.
What���s with the blanket?
How does one get a point?
Looks good.
Whoa!
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
Hell no. She wishes.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Jim. [rolls eyes]
Seen and banged.
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
He didn't smell like a drifter.
It's stupid.
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
What is the status on my wish?
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
Thank you Santa.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Whoa! My stuff!
It's my valuables!
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
Where are we? This ain't my street.
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Ow! Take it easy.
Cake?...You seem a little down.
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...
The Murphy bed of my basement.
Good-timers follow me.
What?
What?
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
Are you sure?
Whoo! Brought some brain food.
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
It's no problem. You live right near me.
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
The main stone's missing.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Shut it, Angela.
To madness.
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
I am...
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
You're the closest one to it.
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
Ow.
What the hell, Toby?
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
My kid didn���t have a face tattoo.
I already spent the money.
Tell me about it.
Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Thank you!
I don't want to!
Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
Nice job.
Lose weight.
Oh my!
Dwight, what the hell?
What?
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
Cool. Free upper.
Don���t dog catch me!
Let me out!
Stop baggin��� my head!
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
Booo! Weird.
Who was messing with my van?
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Sweet.
Oh OOOH!
Boom!
That���s cheating.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
Yahtzee.
Wow.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Topless Christmas.
Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Yes.
Hurry up already.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Take a picture. It will last longer.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
Shave her head. Shave her head!
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Just? Just what? Just forgot?
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Hey, what you doing right now?
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
Forget about it.
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
[starts singing] I come...
Hey!
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Frickin��� A!
Tear up the carpet!
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
Good night.
Hey, boom guy.
When are you gonna boom me?
Got it.
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
[chuckles] Walked right into that one.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Ah, come on.
Tell us!
What's it say?
Boo.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
[as all agree] OK.
I'm not sorry about it.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Wow.
Man, he���s really in twinkle town now.
Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
Uh, two.
Hey! No way!
Yeah!
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
You have to! [everyone grumbling]
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
Speech!
Thank you.
Andy?
Darryl!
Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
Shut up. Jakey?
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
You have to go, Toby.
Hey, bottom drawer.
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
