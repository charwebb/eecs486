Hello?
Uh, I don't know. It's pretty quiet.
Why?
Okay, but there's an 11:00 noise curfew.
Who is Mr. Scott?
No.
She's got it up now.
Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?
Excuse me.
Kay. 'Kay.
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.
It's very.
All right, I get it. We got a deal.
So did the merger go smoothly, or?
Hey, you're the Scranton guy.
I liked your statement tonight.
Oh, very cool.  It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.
See you later.
He asked for a line, like in a play.
OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.
Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.
Then you're an old hand at this.
Fine.  Please be brief.
What does this have to do with sales?
Do you have a card?
These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
Do you mind if we share this bale?
There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.
No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke.
Pay Place.
That's humorous.
So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?
My wife passed away a few years ago.
Thank You.
Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.
Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence.
Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here.
Hey! Lincoln's starting. [light applause]
Quit it.
Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.
Yeah. Little hat.
Yeah.
Eh, you know, it really doesn���t make sense to name the mice. They���re kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You���re not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great.
Hey! It���s Andy Bernard!
