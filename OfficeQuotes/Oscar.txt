Can't you just tell us.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
All right.
It was fine.
Martinez.
What part Native American?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
My parents were Mexican.
Thank... Yeah...
Mexican isn't offensive.
Like what?
What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
I'm just curious.
He literally won't come out of his office.
Michael, can I talk to you?
It's like a pay decrease.
This is not good.
What was that?
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
I don't know.
Well?
OK, the health care plan.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.
I'm reporting you.
Michael I need to talk to you.
[opens door] Michael.
Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside.
Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them.
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
Donate to the charity?
Thank you.
That's... that's... that's very generous.
Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Yeah.
Last year, he walked 18 miles.
How old is she?
Uh, nice party Michael.
Per mile.
Thank you, Michael.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
I never suggested...
Michael, if I gave you...
Thank you.
Okay.
How old is she?
I can help out, if you need me.
What time do we have to come in?
I'm on the phone.
[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
I saw it.
Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
Eh.
It's a scoreboard.
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Yeah.
Sweet!
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
Pair of shoes!
Ah...
Great.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
[in phone] No, no. Finish the...
Pam.
Michael.
What are you implying?
Yes?
Yeah?
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Oh... hey.
Oh. [fixes his dress]
Signed what?
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
Ok, that's a joke.
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.
No, they just made out.  That's it.
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Michael, I don't know what to say.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
Yes.
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Actually, it's just-
Ok...
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
I'm on a call.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Why are we doing this?
I'll take the ... teapot.
You got a bonus check?
I'm in.
Michael? Poor Richard's?
Towards me.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
Creed.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
I'll take the tea pot.
No, I just like tea.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
What did you end up with?
You like music at least?
You're kidding. What was your DJ name?
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Where do you guys think we're going?
Right.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
What's up, Pam?
Ok...
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Hello.
Hello?
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
I have the chills.
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
Are you going to tell Michael?
Hey, Michael.
Hey, Dwight.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
My mom. [puts card in pocket]
Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.
Here you go, Creed.
That's great, man.
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
What the hell is going on here?
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Is that Chet Montgomery?
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
I was in the middle of something.
Stanley.
Who is this guy again?
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Skin cancer is treatable.
It's going to be okay.
...I'll do it.
It wasn't me.
What is this?
No, I have not.
What are you implying?
Okay. I'm done with this.
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Is that true, Toby?
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
How?
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Angela!
Since Christmas.
No.
What's the next one?
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
No.
How 'bout, she takes it down?
Fine.
Again? We do that every year.
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Let it ride. Let it all ride.
No, that's a flush.
What's going on, Michael?
No, it's fine.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
What are you doing?!
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
No one else in this office is gay.
You sound pretty defensive Michael.
I think the problem with this office is that
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
I would rather not.
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
Yes, I'm gay.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
Hey, everyone.
Oh, that's very funny.
[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.
The one of all women?
Because I'm gay?
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Michael --
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
It's her first try.
Meaning what?
Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
[laughs] That's disgusting.
These wings are all fat and bone.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
It was crazy.
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
It was insane!
What are you guys talkin' about?
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
Forty-two.
That's really not our job.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
[on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
[laughs] Yes. [air high five]
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
We do a lot more than that.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
Would you, please? Please.
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
What?
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Turkey is a healthy meat.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Michael...
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
You're not sure that you have the job.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
[laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
So ten
What--- What are you winking for?
Home is where the
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
So she's really going to be fine?
[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
You pushed Darryl out the window?
[to Kevin] Separate cars.
Like what?
Dwight please!
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
More or less.
There's no proof of that.
It's fair.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Oh.
Creed?
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
You did what?
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
I think I'll just take my chances.
It's never gonna happen.
This is why I'm here?
Why aren't you in New York?
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
It's not pizza.
Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?
Because we're looking up jail time.
Thank God.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
Don't.
You know the octagon sign means stop.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
He's not even good at his first one.
Michael, are you having money problems?
You heard me correctly.
Not at all.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Still, that's not anything.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
Mmm.
Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
She has to know.
Michael, this is a presentation tool.
I'm done!
Jan is smart.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Jan.
Michael left.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Jan, he went running that way.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
You have CDs?
Okay, good, okay.  What bank?
[whispers] Case Logic.
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.
Hi.
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
To be Edwardian.  His best work.
Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
What are you doing?
Yes.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
How does it end?
Okay, that's enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy.
Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books.
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
Ok.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
Why don't you just have an apple?
Probably went to his head.
Hey, Jim.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet]
Yeah, yeah.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Elliot!
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Why?
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
They
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
Why are you telling us this?
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
We'll see.
Dunder Mifflin paper.
Hey.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
Totally, they're the best.
Why don't we make corn burgers?
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
I'm gay!
What's the joke?
Oh, you think it's a choice?
I'm messing with you, Holly.
OK.
Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
OK.
[Kelly faints] Oh!
So how was your date?
Oh my God, what happened?
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
How was Friday night?
He'll call.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
It's just...
Have you been to the beach yet?
Okay, Toby, I gotta go.
I thought you were already engaged.
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Exactly, Andy.
Pass.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
That's a big ethical area?
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Me too.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
Great, they stole my laptop.
How does that even compare?
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
100 dollars.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
We'll miss you.
[chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive?
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Okay.
Bye.
Here.
I'm good.
[whispers] Andy brought one too.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
I'll check us in.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand]
Yes.
Michael, why?
How do you even know they're gay?
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
What are you doing?
If you don't mind me asking---
Okay.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
How could anyone stand that woman?
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
I want to know.
You haven't had sex?
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
Why won't you do Andy?
Hey.
Yeah, it was.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
You--- you call--- you called her.
Alright.
Okay.
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
Mmm...
What is first base with Angela?
I had a good time too.
Thank you.
No.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
No kidding.
The note.  So 'holier than thou'.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Right there.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
So you have an extra dollar.
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
So Michael, what do you think?
Michael?
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
That's the original.
Do you know?
I think you know.
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Why'd you say dollars?
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
You're gonna get us a copier then?
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
Hey, we're going with the chairs.
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
What about February 2nd?
Now? It's our Christmas party.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Where did you get this?
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
That's impossible.
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
There you go.
You said that yesterday.
This is nuts.
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
Kevin, c'mon.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Ah! My hand!  That's hot!
Stay alive!  I'm getting help!
You're too heavy!
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
That's offensive.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
[yelling at Michael in Spanish]
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Wow.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
Where'd you get that kind of money?
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
It could be snacks, or-
Wha-
Good God!
[laughs]
[chuckles]
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
I have no idea.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
TV.
I don't think so.
I can't.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
I was stupid, I told him.
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
I'm not done yet.
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
He's on one of his honeymoons.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
It's possible.
We can stay a little longer.
Come on, we'll all go.
Ten percent?
They're our largest client.
It's gonna hurt.
They can.
Yes, they can.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
These aren't announcements.
Do you have specifics?
Well, it's-
Dunder Mifflin.
At least he is in the building.
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
That's a lot.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
You put a note in my food?
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Five years?
It's just not prudent Michael.
I can't believe this is really happening.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
Phyllis, Phyllis.
Use it in a sentence.
Try another sentence.
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Why don't you just ask him--
What have you been doing?
Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
No.
I don't think so.
Meredith, your boob is out.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
What happened to Phyllis?
You invited someone?
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Just go down, Kevin.
Settle down gentlemen.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
[nodding] I did. Yes.
What?
Are you attracted to other men?
[stares at Andy incredulously]
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
You wanted to see me?
Yeah sure.
Is everything okay?
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
Okay.
[sighs] Oh my God.
Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
Well?
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
Exactly!
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
Again, that gives us no information.
[everyone talking to the camera] Just--
What the hell?!
Someone please explain it to Kevin.
Pleased to meet you.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Him? Him?
You owe me and apology.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Oh...
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
How long do you take to pee?
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
What? What?
It's, it's a completely different name!
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
Pam, I'm sorry--
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
This constitutes identity fraud.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why would I love jail?
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Just- no.  No.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Maybe you're right, who are we to...
Hey.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
My mother's in a wheelchair.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
Oh my. That is small.
Can you breathe okay?
When is the funeral?
Kevin.
How can we not watch this?
It starts on it's own. Let it -
Oh. Did - did you see that?
Jim, you let Michael fall in.
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
Andy bought lunch.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
How?  He can't hit back.
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
You're not gonna answer the phone?
[Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
Those are the bullet points.
That's as simple as I can make it.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
These questions are bush league.
Ummm...
Ok
Um..
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
What?
For me.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
Sure. [puts in the twenty]
Are you kidding me?
Hey, Rockefeller Center!
They finally let you do it!
That's funny.
That's too funny.
There he is.
Is Matt around? I got his check.
Ah, I'll just... wait for him.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
Who?
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
Okay Pam.
Nice to meet you Mark!
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
I think you don't know what you're saying.
I think we can do it.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
But I banked six weeks.
Michael. Reading.
The Atlantic.
I should step into sales myself.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Manual.
What are we, five?
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Congratulations.  That's great.
I have a question.
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
I'm in.
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
You okay? You okay, Stanley?
Hey. Matt, right?
I always come in at 7.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Yeah.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Hey, nice office.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Didn't we? I think we did.
Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
So happy hour.
All right.
So what do you think?
I know.
I couldn't understand a word he said.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
Sure. Hoops!
Hoop it up, right.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Thank you.
Yes.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
El telefono.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Your office is full of genitalia.
That's what he says?'
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Why would you throw something wet at me?
How can you live with yourself?
What's number one?
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
He messed yours up to.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
Yep, here they are.
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
Totally, that's great.
Great.
$50,000?
That's great.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
It was an amateur production, technically.
I don't even wanna know these things!
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
What is this about?
Yes!
What?
We were never lovers!
Huh?
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Yes, it is.
Yeah.
Yes.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
Oh...
You are busy! We're in a meeting!
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
That sounds fake.
Okay.
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Okay.
Meredith, I-
Como estas, senor?
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
Jim what are you doing?
Flip it back please.
Go to the recorded version.
What?!
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
What's your money situation?
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
Bankruptcy?
How long do you think a week is?
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Come on Michael. You can...
Where are you getting this information?
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
Funny Jim. That is funny.
What is it?
Alright. Alright I get it.
That's print.
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Hey Michael.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
I'd love to talk more about it.
Maybe over some coffee later?
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
We have missiles too.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
What?
What's your point.
That's not.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
Why?
State senator.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
Well...
Why would someone hug you?
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
Merry Christmas to you.
A real David and Goliath story.
I'll make it. What are you drinking.
I don't know how to make that.
Who's the senator?
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
I'll get him water.
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
A triple word.
Or moon.
She's stuck on that one thing.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Put the 'q' there, sweetie.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
There's no theater in that.
Well...
We got it! Wow! We got it!
Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Yes.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
Which on in particular?
You suppose?
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Ok. I got one.
Yes!
Irony is such a critical...
Wow.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
That's tasteless, Gabe.
Tasteless.
Who's is it? Who wrote that?
[clears throat]
The numbers are correct, Michael.
[clears throat more loudly]
I jus... I just need a signature.
Yes! The freaking PDA!
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
Yes, yes, absolutely.
So happy. Yeah.
Kevin!
Are you guys listening to this?
Not occasionally. All the time.
Good.
Just leave it how you said...
Okay, this is much worse than before.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
I just told them to do it!
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
She's the one.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
No. [shakes head back and forth]
Where was that.
Will you marry me?
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Michael, This is insane.
[laughing]
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
I forgive you for kissing me!
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
Come on Toby.
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
State Senator.
Brava!
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
You have an address yet in Colorado?
What town do Holly's parents live in?
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
No thank you.
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Pam... I think Robert is gay.
[whispers] So!?
I have a very strong suspicion.
What bathhouse?
[confused, whispers] What?
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Is there a front runner?
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Well...
Are you? [leaves]
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Erin, what are you doing?
Okay. [walks away]
I don't think he meant, that--
Go ahead.
Can I say...?
I think it should be Darryl.
Kelly's on your side.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
Good night Andy.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
I know.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
No, guys.
He���s fine.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
������C-SPAN���?
Let me call you back.
We don���t get it.
Really?
Can you believe this?
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
Come on buddy, get back.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Why would we take the dog?
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
At least.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
Bulk or definition?
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Oh, he's plenty strong.
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
It's really not.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
Wow.
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Narddog. [throws Andy a can]
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
[sigh] What happened, Pam?
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
There is no story.
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
Hmph.
Meredith, don't.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
Nuh uh.
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
Andy. [alert sounds]
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It's not that funny.
[his phone vibrates] He stopped it!
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
No, no. Not even.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
In this case yes.
It's not fair, you guys.
Good luck!
Actually it is the northernmost.
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
he's a historian.
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes!
Argh!
What?
Erin-
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
Yeah.
You���ve heard about it?
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Guys! Over here, we found the bus.
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
How mean are we talking about?
That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]
Yeah, he's in a ladle.
He did it himself.
Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
It's not that kind of ladle.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
Kevin?
Yes!
Wow.
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
No!
That's no accident.
What?
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
Dwight.
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
Andy, no-
[clicks tongue] Aw...
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
What? No!
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Good luck.
Salman Rushdie.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
No! Come on!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Oh, who needs a house that size?
Kevin, no.
That was you, Kevin.
[sees wine collection] Holy cow!
How many bottles? Three hundred?
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
To both these bears.
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Knock, knock. Oh!
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Kevin!
Wow, it's so... healthy.
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Angela.
I knew that, I knew it.
Chicken marsala.
Mm-hmm.
Dwight. Hey.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Don't you want to see the baby?
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
She got pregnant before the wedding.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
Angela, you look amazing.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
...Andy.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
It's maddening!
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
Un-be-liev-a-ble.
Andy.
Order reference number 00983-126.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Terrific.
Good job Andy.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
You���ve gotta be kidding me.
No, Kevin -- [sighs]
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
I am dying to know what's in there.
We knew. Ryan told us.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
What does that mean?
She's always late, she's always rude...
Yeah.
Listen to this.
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Plus everyone would know who you meant.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Yeah.
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
What is this?
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Oh, come on.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
What's going on?
my dog Gerald is my life.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
I know!
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
This is interesting.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
okay
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
Why did Binghamton close?
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
Do you not own a mirror?
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
It's not misleading.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
What?
David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
No, I���m a dog person.
Those guys always change back, Angela.
Definitely no.
But your mouth is ble���
You know what? I will take Comstock.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
C���est la vie.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
Pam's first celebrity crush.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Really?
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
Shh!
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
What if it were salads?
Dwight!
Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts]
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
Role call.
Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
Actually I���m the electoral college.
I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
Can you do this, Kevin?
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Perfect.
Kevin!
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
That's a tough one.
I'm in big trouble.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
So...
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
I hope that's it, Kevin.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Those figures I gave you? They're false.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Yes, he's innocent.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
Sure.
That's gotta be tough.
Well, I am sorry Kevin.
No.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
U..s..a. U-
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
Hi.
More like fall cleaning. [chuckles]
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
Oh, I���m sure ...that���s nothing.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Angela, I���ll go with you.
Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
[whispering] Please. It���s Robert who���s enjoying it.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
He���s making a phone call.
[phone vibrates, rings]
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
Good morning. [clears throat]
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
No, thank you, Angela.
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
I brought you a cookie.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
What?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
I got it.
What the hell, Dwight?
you are incorrigible!
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
Angela, it���s a lead freaking pipe.
Aah!
I���m so sorry. Angela--
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
Just take her name off of everything.
How would anyone even know--
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
Ow! You hit people with that thing?
Pam, really? Come on.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
Wow.
You're a saint, Pam.
Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
You're waterboarding me!
I guess so.
Hey, look who���s back, Dwight Junior.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
YOLO! [singing and dancing]
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
Well���
Yes!
That���s enough Kevin.
That���s enough!
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
Huh?
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
Everybody shut up and work!
[with horns honking] Kevin, can-
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
What?
Aw.
���Loyalty pledge���?
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
Oh.
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
Pam, what can be done?
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Yeah.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
He put me here.
Ow! Robert?!
Yes. Sorry about that.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
We are together. Romantically.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
You're clearly snooping.
That's her private property.
Andy. That is her private property.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
Can someone please help me?
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
You have a brother?
They're a descriptive people.
Who is that?
Dwight has a sister?
She's beautiful.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
Toby, how do you propose that we-
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
Dumpster Man.
���Three PM Girl���
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Meredith!
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
They caught us kissing on Halloween.
Oh!
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
You call him!
Stop hitting me!
No!
Oh you?
Hey, Hey Robert!
Hey.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Very much so.
Absolutely.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
I think that's it!
Done!
Ok!
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
What?
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
He knew!
You did it, Kevin.
What?!
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
But you just!
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
That���s���that���s awful, Angela. I���m so sorry.
Angela, you still have your son.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Good night, Kevin.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
Come stay with me.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Separate bathrooms.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
And get you the hell outta that place.
Oh, Angela.
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Angela, you just were���
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Angela, someone wants you.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Why?
Hi, buddy.
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
Here, use my pen.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
I think there���s, like, $7 left.
Sure.
Easy.
Hey, no.
No horseplay.
Ok, I���ve got my���
All right, Meredith.
See you there.
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Oh, my goodness.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Ooh.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
You���re back?
Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Yeah!
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
Yeah, brosef.
Well, I bet it was a smash.
Is that a volunteer program or���
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
What is that?
Thank you David.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
You���re not gay.
