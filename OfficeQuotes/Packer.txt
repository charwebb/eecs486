Your mom, you gay nerd!
It was pretty big.
Yeah.
Left it in the middle of your office.
[laughs uproariously]
Special delivery!
Sit on the throne, Michael.
Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
No.
Well, no. I got nothing.
Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
Halpert!  Tall, queer, handsome as ever.  Hey everybody it's me, Jim.  Hello, hello.  Todd Packer.
Shut up!
Shut it!
Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
What happened?
Quick somebody help!  Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael]
I have a full day of sales calls.
[Breaks pencil.]
And what kind of stripper did you get?
You didn't order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101.  If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.
Just get one for the girls too.  That evens it out.  You know, separate but equal.
Quick query, Halpert.
Still queer?
You can't put me down. Too strong!
Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
I can do it.
I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.
Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
Did you say 'masturbator?'
Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.
This is great. This is gonna be great.
Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
Drama queen, am I right?
That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
-features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.
Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
It would be an honor, ma'am.
Cookies. Bet you anything it���s cookies.
That's great.
Not good enough (clicks tongue)
I'll be there at 6:00
Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Thank you.
I will be here.
Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
Alright.
