Are we ready to sign some papers?
It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
Whenever you're ready.
Actually yes.
Whenever you're ready, Michael.
What?
Michael, this is the unit you saw and...
Who told you that?
Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
That's some extra income for you.
You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
Hello.
Hello, hi. Hey, Michael.
How?
Michael?
Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
No just the front two.
Sure.
[on phone] Hello, Michael?
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Oh, great.
Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
Oh, great.
To the casino thing?
What?
No problemo.
To answer your question...
Yes.
I'd love to go.
I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
And I'll bring the papers, too.
I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Drink would be good.
Wow, bad luck.
What does that mean?
Hi, hi.
No, I'm good.
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
Well, I'm having a nice time.
All right.
You, too.
Goodbye.
She seems really nice.
[wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
An Indian woman in a sari.
What? Too spicy?
They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Are you okay?
Oh, Michael.
Can we talk about this in private?
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?
This is the ninth date, Michael.
I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
Okay.
Okay, good night, Michael.
You're the temp!
Hi, I'm Carol.
The wavy brown hair and blue eyes.
Michael talks about you... a lot.
Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?
[pause] Yes.
He says... 'I love him.' He loves you.
Hi, is Michael around here?
Michael.
[whispers] What?
Get outta here.
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.]
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]
No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
I went on a ski trip.
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Michael.
This is so weird.
I think you're a really sweet guy.
But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
What are you talking about?
Oh, no. Michael.
Michael...
I'm sorry.
I know. [Closes door.]
[whispering] I���m so sorry. They were an hour late.
