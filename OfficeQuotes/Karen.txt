[laughing] Yeah.
Scared?
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
Just tap S then D.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
Um, shoot.  Uh, I will.  Sorry.
[at vending machine] Dammit.
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Yeah, all day.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Mm.
Yeah, nothing there.
[laughing] Six?
I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
Thanks.
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
[squeaky chair] Hey.
My chair is squeaking.
You took my chair.
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
That's it? That's what you came up with?
Really?
[rocks in squeaky chair]
stop.
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
This is not a proportionate response.
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
Nice basket.
Oh. Did you shake it?
Thanks.
Got it.
Ooh.
Andy, no acappella.
Oh, come on, guys. Please.
It's not good.
Goodnight, guys.
Hey dummy, get in the car!
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Yeah, you can't.
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Good.
[looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel.
Hey.
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
What you gonna do?
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
This is going to be an adventure.
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
Hi.
Karen. I love your sweater.
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
...to knit.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Mm-hm.
[recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.
Uh, what's that smell?
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Who's Bob Vance?
Shouldn't we be equals?
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
How are we going to get home?
Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
Yeah.
Ok.
Hey, nice thermos.
Yeah.
Uh no, I'm fine, thank you.
Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.
Hey.
...Almost done?
Hey I got one.
Jesus.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
Hey.
What is going on?
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
A Christmas drinking game ...
What?
You're kidding.
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
Right.
Oh cool, yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, we do a raffle...
What's your funding?
Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
I think that's a really good option...
He's cute. You should date him.
Yup.
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
Hey, so what's the status.
Oh, you're kidding me?
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Do you like it?
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
Yeah, thanks.
OK.
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
And now we get to remember it forever.
Thank you. [Both hug]
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
Nope.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
What are the ingredients of poi?
You sure?
I think I owe you one.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.
Oh, uh, thanks.
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
Let's go get a broom.
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Yeah, thank you.
Thanks. That was fun.
Thank you.
That's nice.
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Yeah.
You ready Jim?
So, let me ask you a question.
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
I moved here from Connecticut...
Kay.
What happened on your sales call?
Hey.
Yeah, you should not encourage him.
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend.
Yep.
That's rude.
Mr. Franklin?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Really?
Okay.
So um, well good.
What are you sorry about?
What are you sorry about?
A toaster.
Yeah. P and R?
Ah, of course.
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Oh my God!
Oh, what happened?
But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
What glare?
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Rachel, your house is beautiful.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
And it didn't end well.
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
I so got you.
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
Hey Jan.
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
See ya Pam.
So do you want to see it or not?
Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.
Yeah.
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
...and we're gonna go to dinner.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
[shrieks]
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you.
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Fifty-one.
It's a strategy!
Thank you.
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
That's three times in ten minutes.
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
No.
I'm good.  Thanks.
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
I'm saying that you're being sexist.
That - it's the same thing.
Can we just get back to work?
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
It's a pretty common one.
That is not healthy behavior.
OK, OK. Um, cons.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Answer it.
OK, remember, be strong.
Hole?
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Get 'em big boy!
C'mon, Jim!
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
As well.
Yes. uh, huh.
That would be fine.
[whispering] Cut it out!
Hey.
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
[confused] Oh. Okay.
Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
[looks annoyed]
Heh.
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Oh.
Cause of Jan again?
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
Thanks.
Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Do you want to get back together with her?
Do it.
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Wow!
I know!
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
Cause I'm going to get the job.
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
How often do you come here?
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Well,
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
Yeah?
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
He would be disaster.
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh]
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Just call me when you're done.
Good luck, Halpert.
Yeah.
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
[on phone] Hello?
Michael...
Listen, I-
I'm-
You called me.
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Toby's not a salesperson.
Oooh.  Good-bye Michael.
Jim?
Uh, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
I'm taking Stanley.
Jim, hang on a second?
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
[huffs]
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Hey. Hi, guys.
What!
Of course not!
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
But now we think you're a liar.
Uh, it's very insulting.
Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Uh, in about a month.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
That's so great. That's great.
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
How's Jim?
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
