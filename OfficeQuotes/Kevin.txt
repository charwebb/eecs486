I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
I remember.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
It was kind of hard to hear.
Hey.
You wanna go to the beach?
You wanna get high?
I think you do, mon.
[Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
What are you guys talking about?
That's a real thing.
Someone has it.
Do you think we should go ?
What is he doing?
Italian.
Yeah.
Their bread's really good.
I have a hoop in my driveway.
I can't work Saturday.
I'm in a band.
It's a Steve Miller Tribute Band.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
She's prettier than you though.
[nods]
What is your type?
Stay away from my mom.
Do you like Steve Miller?
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
MILF!
She wasn't that hot.
Phyllis?
Packer said it.
You mean where my desk is?
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
[Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?
You can see her...
How do you know?
[paper football lands on desk] Ooh.
Or when we're bored.
We're bored a lot.
Oh!
We call it Hate Ball.
Because of how much Angela hates it.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
It smells like cookies.
[empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth]
All right.
Yes, thank you.
Please...
Please, please. Please.
Present company excluded?
Pam.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
[clears his throat]
Was it worth it?
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
Really?
I would love that.
Yeah.
Yeah. Oh.
Stacy.
Sweep the leg.
Later Jim.
Don't look at me. [smiles at camera]
Michael's movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.
Most of that is good.
I heard they made out and had sex.
Well, I heard they made out
Romances?
Oooo.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
That's pretty young.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Oh.
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
Hey, Kelly; I called him Fire Guy.
Yeah... hey Stanley-
It never gets old.
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Do we have one?
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
I want the foot bath.
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Kevin Malone.
[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.
Mine.
Thanks for the party, Michael.
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
Can you hop?
I think that's from Big.
What does that mean?
The thing you just said?
Whhh... What are you guys doing?
Michael is that a wig?
No.
Jim has got it bad for Pam.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
Nice... she is
What's goin' on?
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
Me?
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Michael. [tapping on door]
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
It smelled
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
[blows a sigh of relief]
That sucks so much.
Woah. [Delivery man with flowers]
Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]
Man, that thing's bigger than I am.
Oh zip it.
Whose it from? [to Oscar]
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
You should go to Hedonism.
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
I always set it at 69. [snickers]
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Go ahead.
What're you doing? You never have plans.
Niiice.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
No. I'm still waiting.
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Um, I might have skin cancer.
Right.
Hello? Hey.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
Still scary.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
I can't relax about it, you know?
No, not yet.
Okay, Michael.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
[nods] Hey...
[giggling]
That is so good, Michael
I'm not taking Rogaine.
I'd like a magazine.
I'd still like one.
Nice.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
I accept your decision!
No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.
Morning.
Something with animals. Or people.
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Come on, Dwight.
Yes.
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Yeah, I think she's full of it.
Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
All-in.
Three queens.
I suck.
I do not want to talk about it.
Yeah?
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
Dude, you will not be sorry.
All right.
: That sounds great.
So did you hear?
Pam's back on the market again.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
Yes!
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
Do you have any savings?
Michael, you might lose your condo.
Nnnnice. Wow!
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
...ces. [chuckles]
Nothing.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
No. [chuckles]
Not really.
No.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Account...? Michael, what is going on?
Night, Pam.
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Nice outfit.
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
Excellent.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Where are we going?
How about Cugino's?
How 'bout Cooper's then?
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Hooters?
Yes! [hugs Angela]
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
All right.
Cool.
[interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming?
Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
Can I have your pencils?
Oh, yes I can.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
The beef is poisoned?
Staples.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
Hidden from [whisper] them.
See you later, Jim.
[to Angela] It's his first day back.
[smiles] I like it.
Kevin Malone.
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
The Penguin.
Okay, Penguin. [laughs]
Michael, have you met the Penguin?
Yeah.
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
Hmm.
Andy.
Hmm. Martin?
Wait, why am I a racist?
He is black... right? And...
Yeah!
I wonder what he did.
Cool.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
You got outdoors time?
Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?
I would so rather be in prison.
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
The tires look pretty worn.
That's not fair.
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
Then why are there two flyers?
Right.
I didn't see where it was.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
Don't push it.
You've got to be kidding!
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
Right.
Dude, you should know.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Already sent it to you my friend.
Jan.
Hi Jan, you look... tan.
Yeah. How was it?
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
You look like you have the munchies.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Yeah.
Angela.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
How much did you win?
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Thanks, so sweet.
Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Can I join too?
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Michael.
[Mouths 'hi' at the stripper]
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Riiight. The gym. [snickers]
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
...What?
I almost died.
Wow.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Your name looks really nice.
Is everything ok, Michael?
Hey Pam.
Oscar. Angela.
Yeah.
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
No, it is here.
Good thing you didn't listen to me.
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Because of reasons...
Are there carbs in vodka?
Sup?
Later, Jim.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
You're wearing a woman's suit?
Who makes it?
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Five bucks says it's over 50.
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
[mouths] Damn...
On what?
Nice.
Long johns?  A shaw?
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
That is lame.
Oh, geeze.
Damn it.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
No, constantly.  Like, for
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
Here you go. [hands money]
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
I'm sorry.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
Are you going to beat me up?
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
[in accent] 'ello, mate!
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
[thinks] Eleven.
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.'
Still said it.
Ooh, can I be a pirate?
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
I'm guessing not.
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
You aren't curious?
Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
[quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.
[in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
Yes.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
You're in here.
[all get up to leave] OK.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Are you going to try it?
Angela, it is a million degrees.
Why don't you go Michael?
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
What's different about you? You look worse.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Pam is taller.
Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
I think Karen has a prettier face.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Yeah.
Will do.
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
What?
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
[raises hand] Do we have to?
[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
Are you kidding me?
Who's we, you and Jim?
Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
Oh, I bet you ask?
I bet you were.
What
Whoa!
[applauds]
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
Michael?
You cannot make me run.
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
You didn't run for me...
...when I thought I had skin cancer.
No.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Back off me.
That seems early, even for her.
That'd be DUI.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
I knew it!
[rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!
You weren't here for that.
When he started the fire.
Little old man boy.
Bearded man boy.
No way!
Yeah, later dude.
Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
What does that mean?
Tuna Tuna Tuna.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
Tuna. Check you later.
Hi, Creed, what's up?
What do you mean?
Wha...
Dude, you gotta believe.
That was so awesome.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
No, no.
Oscar, talk to him.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
What's going on?
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Good pizza.
Different stuff.
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Dammit.
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
I don't know.
I do gamble Michael.
The mob.
[shakes head no]
Yeah, women be shoppin'.
Shh.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
[waves] Hi.
[looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
Michael, that was fun.
Damn it!
Damn it! [banging machine]
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
Oh, I'll take 'em.
You never call back.
About what?
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
[off screen] Hurts like hell.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Not anymore.
It's a bitter situation.
No, thirty.
Yes.
Nice.
Michael, please he--
We need to assemble the five families.
We have to.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
[to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.
[nervously stuttering] I... have... things...
We want our parking spaces back!
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
We did it.
We got our spaces back.
Later.
Way to go, man.
Oh God.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Michael you could put your initials in it.
Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Like librarians.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
Andy, you're up, let's go!
Yeah.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
He's not my client.
Hi.
I do the numbers.
Do you want a M&M?
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Yeah.
Hi.
I can't decide what to get.
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Hmm...
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Okay, bye.
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
Just hurry. [hangs up]
It was great to see you, Jan.
Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Yeah.
I'll go to the diner with you.
Yeah, we can go eat pie.
Me too.
Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
Yeah.
Hi Jan.
How's the candle game?
Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
Hey!
Thank you, Holly.
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Oh, my God!
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan]
Yeah.
You too.
Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
It's a trap.
I think we're out.
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Wait, what?
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Yeah.
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
It was like two hundred dollars.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
But Phyllis, it's not his baby.
Michael, the baby's already been born.
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
I donated sperm.
Maybe I'm the father.
Next to the IHOP?
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
Jan?  What's new?
Seriously?  You're okay with that?
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
Federal and State.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
Well, Hol, this is it.
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
You love your mom.
T minus...
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
[with mouth full] Yes.
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
Michael's a genius.
Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Whoo-hoo!
Hot tamales.
Uh oh.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
We're not listening.
Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
She looks like a monster.
That is not the question.
Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.
So what do we do now?
The debate is whether she is hot.
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
[surprised] Wait, what?
This is ridiculous.
It's out in the hall.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
Call it.
I would want to live with no legs.
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
I'm almost done.
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
It... yeah.
Wait, you didn't give it back?
Any cat, you mean.
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
[gasps]
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
No way.
Oh, the other one's watching.
[snickers]
This is getting weird.
Ohhh...
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Oh, then pick TV.
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
I miss Stacy.
I can't even imagine.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Hello.
I'm from here!
Thank you, Michael.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Are you on email?
Cool. Bye.
Good Valentine's.
I think I should call her.
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
But I do like her just the way she is.
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Right.
[puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Ni-
Hey!
Michael?
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Ok.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Michael is that scotch?
Pam?
When will the new copier be ready?
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Sometimes.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
I think he's singing.
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
But you didn't want to start with us?
Phones?
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Oh, man!
Hold it.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Wag.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Try it in another sentence.
I guess I could be nicer.
Hi.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
So, like, a disco cafe?
Yeah.
Yeah. This place is great.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Respect the lei.
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?
I wanted a cookie.
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
Oh...cause you smell like bacon.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
Michael, isn't that Holly?
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
Set!
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Q.
T.
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
Reeeeally.
[looks at Andy and giggles]
[still giggling] Tea.
You would.
[sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it.
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Because you're gay.
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Stay.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
Hey, we're gonna do this...
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Will you take a check?
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Wait til' Monday.
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Totally!
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
What does a bean mean?
Michael, what does a bean mean?
What does a bean mean?!
What does a bean mean?
Michael!
So... you're going to provide them, then?
What the hell?
Oh yeah.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
She thought I was your boyfriend.
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
Yes.
Are you seeing anyone right now?
Cool.
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Yes!
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
It's a good idea.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
What else you got?
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Thank you.
They were stolen?
What?
But that was my only pair of shoes.
Well... well damn-it.
Okay.
Oscar.  Angela.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Who would want it?
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
[answers phone] Hello.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
Six-six-five-zero.
Wait a minute. Yes I am.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
No-
Shoot.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Because... You would love it.
Hi Pam, is Jim there?
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.
They have no idea what happened.
Oooh yeah... [people chuckle] Jim and Pam!
[to Angela] Shhhh...
[to Angela] Shhh...
Who's pickle?
Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
[whispers to Erin] I'm gonna kill you.
Yeah. Every single day.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
We'll stay late.
Open QuickTime.
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
Hi.
Because of sex?
My money's on Pam.
Michael could win.
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
We're here for the show, Michael.
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
It smells like throw up in here.
Whoa, I'll try it.
Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
Y'all.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Nice.
That could be a good sign.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
Michael, I hated the twirl.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Does and email count?
Yeah. [everyone raises hands again]
Hey.
Jim said that?
Jim said that?
No, no, that makes total sense.
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Congrats Phil!
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
When can I sit on your lap?
That's really comfortable. [Michael gasps]
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Awesome.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
He got scented candles!
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
Thank you.
Yeah.
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Hi!
What, no candy?
Hi.
Jo, there's books in my chair.
Nice!
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
I think it should be a surprise.
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Stick spicy food up her butt.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
I'm petrified.
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Yes!
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Erin, would you have lunch with me?
Yes!
Bye.
Hi.
She touched my shoulder.
No.
Yes.
Hi.
Yeah, me too.
Really, really fun.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You said she liked me.
I've dumped better than Erin.
Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
Oh I'm in.
You are never going to find them.
I'm going to enjoy this.
[muffled] I'm still enjoying  it.
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
What -
Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Yeah! [hugs Pam]
Oh, I missed you so much.
Yeah!
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Yeah!
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
No. I won't say it.
Angela, this is inappropriate.
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
I'm not crying.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Yeah.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
C' is for suspension.
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Thank you.
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Well, why don't you shut up!
I think it's over, man.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Ooh.
That's hilarious.
Boi-oi-oi-ing
Wow. That is crazy.
Yeah. That's pretty bad.
That is a dangerous game, friendo.
Why not your condo?
No.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Well, now I think I might not.
Wait, are they searching all our computers?
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
[offscreen] No, it does not!
Well, what if you're cold?
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
That was awesome!
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
I never seen herpes on you.
You have a penis?
Michael, you're at least forty six!
It feels unbelievable!
...unbelievable.
It feels amazing!
Yes.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
Nice.
I could sing it.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
He's like a better-looking Andy.
Yeah.
Oh, nice!
Or the me that stinks.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Croak!
Nice.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
You own a bar?
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Or you're dead.
Okay.
I am so sorry.
I just thought-
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
[bleep] you, Gabe!
Pam. Can you vote for other people?
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Hey, you going tonight?
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
No he's not the boss.
Cause, you're the boss!
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
I can't believe we're missing that!
Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
Big Boobs.
Wow.
Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
Dunh-duh-na-dah!
You had me at 'Sex.'
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Thank God.
Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
Well, I wish for a million wishes.
Then see you later building.
I said see you later building.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Oh, right. The state senator.
Oh, that would be impressive... if
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Yeah.
Hi, Toby.
Yeah.
Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
Oh no, that's, that's not happening.
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
Wow, that's awesome!
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
God, I hate it.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Can I get some candy, or something?
You were super mean.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
Well, I am. [hugs Michael]
I'm going to help you.
Hey, Ryan.
How's your fart project coming?
Me.
Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Then I won't let you down.
Yep.
Go.
[running laps around the conference room] Yes!
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
No. Yes!
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
What?
Red gloves.
I can't wait.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
Ditto.
Nice!
Yes, well done!
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Oooh.
Booby honking.
Butt honking.
As has Kevin!
She goes to another school.
Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
Better luck next time, pal.
Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Or carnivals!
You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Yes!
Nice! We got burned!
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
I have very little patience for stupidity.
[giggling] Mean but good!
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
I do know how to read though!
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
200
45
Damn it.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Yea.
Nice.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
No but that's not fair.
Hey guys it's my turn.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
And that is Dallas. [shows money]
That's awesome!
All of us?
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Interesting.
Awesome!
Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
[walks in] Hi!
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
For birthdays!
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Oh...
Better...
But...
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Sounds beautiful!
I'm going to!
Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
I know...
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Yes!
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
Yes.
Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Didn't drop a single ball!
Hot!
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
[heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Whoa.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
You could put a banana in it.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
Hey, Jo!
No, under the jacket.
I don't feel anything.
Push harder, Dwight.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Don't eat it.
Another one?
Thank you.
Nice.
Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Um... Business!
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
Yeah! Tell us a story.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
We don't tell her.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
[giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Later, man.
Exactly.
We need a warning signal.
We do.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
I know! It���s alphabetical.
Warning! Warning! Warning!
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
I was looking for patterns.
Chicken piccata, side salad.
Yes. Me do.
Me do it now.  Go.  Stop worry.
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
You keep think that.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
Thank.
But save time. More success.
No me fault.
Many small time make big time.
See world.
See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.
Fine, fine.  I���ll talk normally.
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
This is where we go
It���s a answer.
There are no wrong answers.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
So���DARRYL! A GIRL!
Kevin.
No!
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
For sure.
[murmurs from group in agreement]
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
Right. My mom-
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Here...
Oh hey guys.
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
Egons.
No.
However it's normally done.
Yeah Jim, why's it so far?
Back...
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!
No no no!
Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
[mouthful of food] I understand.
I think this thing is broken.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
What?
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
It's been out for ages, man.
Jim, put it on.
Come on, the Three Amigos.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
Yeah [nervously]���prank
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Exactly.
Nooo!
Thank you.
I'm on it.
Good thinking.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
Yeah.
Guys come on. I'm right here.
Isn't it supposed to be, 'Drive safely'?
Yes!
Hey, screw you!
We're called Kevin and the Zits.
I have a tambourine.
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
We all got to go sometime.
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
You do that on TV!
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
[music plays] Whoo!
Mm-hmm.
Are you serious? From Star Trek?
Yeah.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
Yes!
Not food and stuff.
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
The fire pit is a no-brainer.
[tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Thank you.
I don���t know.
Yes.  I am an accountant.
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
What?!? No!
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
I can do that.
Your arm feels good on my back.
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Hey, man.
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Good cookie.
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Hey.
So, there was talk of oatmeal.
This.
Oh yeah!
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
Hey! I can make that error.
No, I-
Okay. [leaves]
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
Ron Artest, Kelly.
Nicely done!
Oh yeah!
Three hundred pounds!
[rings bell] Les Jolies Choses.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
[holds up 'Robitussin'] Riboflavin?
Thank you.
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
Oh, will we get to see that look?
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
It was me.
Whoa.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Wow!
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
No!
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
You know.
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Oh, did I win the pool?
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
Got that, bimbo?
Hi!
Phillip is so fat.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
[giggles] Little Kevin.
Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
Hey!
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
When do we leave?
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Are those the lyrics?
One order.
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
One order.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Listen, it���s important. You���ve gotta hear this.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
Yeah [all murmuring]
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
Bye.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Cookies, eh?
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
I do.
Oh, I definitely do.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Hungrier.
Hungrier.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
[holding mobile phone up] Go.
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
What do you mean?
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
Nice.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
oooh
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
Hot tub party?
I do. [applause] Come on everyone...
Come on Jim, you're killing her!
None taken.
Shh, here she comes!
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
Welcome home.
Yeah.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
Tip-top shape.
Ooh, ooh!
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Oh man, this is weird!
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
No. No he's not.
You're welcome!
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
The branch closed. Forever.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Wait, C-R-A-Z...
Even I know that's weird.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
I���ll take him.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
Go ahead
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
A wheel is supposed to spin.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
This sucks.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
[grinning] Oh boy! What's happening?
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Totally. George Clooney.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
And John Wayne?
Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
Yeah, that���you're being really mean, Andy.
As would I.
My name is Kevin.
That is my name.
They call me Kevin.
Cause that's my name.
Next stop pies!
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Wh...
314 pies.
Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
I insult you, Oscar.
I insult you! To your face!
Then why don't you do something about it?
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
What happened?
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
I... did not.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
Please, stop.
Please, stop.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
Hi.
Oscar, we're in the middle of talking.
Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]
What are you doing?
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Nice!
That���s the winter season., three months.
What���s happening in three months?
Make it go taller.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
Me and Pete are building a tower.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Huh?
Yep, yep, yep.
Okay, I got this one.
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
Yeah.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
I am Oscar Martinez.
Wha-- wh--
Nice! Yeah.
Nice. Nice.
You did it.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
No.
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
No, it's not.
I wish my car had a bathroom.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
No.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
No.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Yeah [kisses Darryl on the cheek]
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
An Escalade.
Big mistake.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
Taste test? I���m in!
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
No way.
Ok guys, ���we all drink them all���.
Yes!
Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela]
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Two��� [picks Angela up again]
Three���
Four!
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
Pam, look out!
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
So long, noise!
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Yeah!
I don���t get it.
A lightbul--
Whoa.
Whoa.
That���s a flush.
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
Let���s get this over with, Pam.
Meredith, I tell you all the time.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...
Whoa.
Pete...
Pete what?
I'm Kevin.
Didn't you two used to do it?
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
You don't know that.
James Bond was a spy.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
Why would you ask me?
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Nope. I did not see you either.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
Uh oh. She's doing it again.
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Andy, are there documentary groupies?
Of course.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Cool. Superhero.
Ooh, there���s Angela! I work with her!
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Yes, we did it!
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
Ohh.
Yes!
Uh huh.
Of course.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
No.
This is flatter.
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly]
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Wait, all of them?
I���ve never met anyone like that.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
Our question is���it seems dumb.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
I don���t think so.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
What do you think that was about?
[everyone applauding] Awesome!
Night, Oscar.
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Guys.
Guys.
Guys.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Whoa.
That���s totally uncool.
Right. Now.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Don���t tell me what to do!
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Phillip got this for me?
That was a really cool move.
Whoa.
What a chubbers. Whoa.
I���m losing my balance.
Whoa!
You wanna play with the cactus?
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Bye, Phillip. High five.
Yeah.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Yes!
I feel scared a little.
Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Yes! Wait, why?
���Get out.���
What does that mean?
I���m���good.
[crying] At least I got chocolate.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Well, w���
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Is that all it was?
Come here [hugs Dwight]
I missed you!
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
[laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
Where���s the, uh, basket for gifts?
Okay.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
That���s not���
[to Oscar] What was that stuff?
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Oh, I don���t know.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Yes!
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
What is it?
Oh, Yes!
Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I���m gay.
[sniffles] It���s just that I���m so emotional.
No, but maybe the reason���
