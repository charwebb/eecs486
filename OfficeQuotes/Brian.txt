Nothing. You���re doing the best you can.
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
Hey, it���s just a tough situation, all right?
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
Yeah, hold on a sec.
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
Will do.
Sure.
Oh, hey Meredith.
Uh, listen, they���re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It���s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna��� I, I���ll see you later.
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
You're gonna hit a woman?
No. No, it's...
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
Seeya.
Hey.
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
At least my crying won't get you fired.
Oh, hey!
Hi. [laughs]
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
Let me grab a couple drinks.
Alright, that's for you. [hands her beer]
Cheers.
So...
What brings you by?
Oh yeah, that's right.
Yeah, it is.
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
Yeah, it was cool.
Um...
No no, it's-
No, you're not crazy.
Yeah.
They want to know how much what?
Pretty much everything.
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
That's not really true, I mean-
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
