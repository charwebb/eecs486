I thought we were going to spend the day together.
(interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.
Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me.
He told me not to get involved with you.
Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza...
The other day after work some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...
(interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.
George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult.
Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?
George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...
