Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel.
And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
[looking at a copy of Michael's diary] Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as 'Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way.'
You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.
Okay, Mr. Scott, would you mind, um, speaking in your normal voice for us.  Please.
Two years ago, when you quote 'kissed and fondled in the Chili's parking lot' [Jan sighs and shakes her head], were you aware of company guidelines specifically discouraging that behavior?
We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
Okay.  Were you aware that when Jan was with you, she claimed to be visiting clients, or, uh, traveling to see her sister in Scottsdale?
OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.
It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.
