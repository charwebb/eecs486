Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel.
Okay.  Were you aware that when Jan was with you, she claimed to be visiting clients, or, uh, traveling to see her sister in Scottsdale?
You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.
[looking at a copy of Michael's diary] Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as 'Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way.'
Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.
It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
Two years ago, when you quote 'kissed and fondled in the Chili's parking lot' [Jan sighs and shakes her head], were you aware of company guidelines specifically discouraging that behavior?
And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
Okay, Mr. Scott, would you mind, um, speaking in your normal voice for us.  Please.
Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please? [slides the performance review towards Michael]
