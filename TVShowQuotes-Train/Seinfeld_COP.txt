You're under arrest.
This your apartment?
Yeah.
This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
Oh boy.
That's smog strangler.
Thanks.
Looks like it.
Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
Mr. Costanza?
Yeah! You got a problem with that?
Your what?
Yeah, go ahead.
What?
Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
You're under arrest.
Boy, that's some cough you got there.
(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!
(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!
Looks like a possible 5-19.
You recognize this piece of fabric?
Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
Cut it up back there.
You Cosmo Kramer?
I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
Hey!
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
What is your problem?
Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
You mean a purse?
I don't think so.
Shut up.
What?
Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.
I got a little hungry.
Well, well. The 'white whale'.
Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
What do got over there?
