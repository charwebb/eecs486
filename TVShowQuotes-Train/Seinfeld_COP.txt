You mean a purse?
Yeah? So why didn't you?
I don't think so.
Yeah, go ahead.
You're under arrest.
Yeah.
Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
That's smog strangler.
What do got over there?
Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
Well, well. The 'white whale'.
Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
Mr. Costanza?
Shut up.
This your apartment?
Hey!
Yeah! You got a problem with that?
What?
You're under arrest.
I got a little hungry.
Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
Boy, that's some cough you got there.
This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!
Cut it up back there.
You Cosmo Kramer?
I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
What?
Thanks.
You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
Yeah.
Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
Oh boy.
Looks like a possible 5-19.
Looks like it.
(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!
You recognize this piece of fabric?
Your what?
