Mr. Costanza?
You're under arrest.
Yeah, go ahead.
Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
Shut up.
You Cosmo Kramer?
Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
Yeah? So why didn't you?
Boy, that's some cough you got there.
What?
Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
What do got over there?
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
Well, well. The 'white whale'.
Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
I don't think so.
Oh boy.
Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
That's smog strangler.
Yeah.
Your what?
Hey!
Looks like a possible 5-19.
Looks like it.
(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!
You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
What?
You're under arrest.
What is your problem?
Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
Yeah! You got a problem with that?
Cut it up back there.
(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
This your apartment?
