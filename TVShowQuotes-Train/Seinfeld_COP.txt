You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
Yeah? So why didn't you?
Yeah! You got a problem with that?
This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
You mean a purse?
Yeah, go ahead.
Boy, that's some cough you got there.
Looks like a possible 5-19.
That's smog strangler.
Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
Hey!
This your apartment?
Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
What?
Well, well. The 'white whale'.
(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!
Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
Yeah.
Your what?
Shut up.
Yeah.
What do got over there?
(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!
Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
What?
You recognize this piece of fabric?
Thanks.
I don't think so.
I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
What is your problem?
Cut it up back there.
Oh boy.
Mr. Costanza?
I got a little hungry.
Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
You're under arrest.
You Cosmo Kramer?
Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
