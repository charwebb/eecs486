I'd like a hotdog, please.
Name tags, hmm?
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
Here y'go.
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
No, it's no problem.
You sure you don't want any yogurt?
Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
I'll run in and get the gum.
Sorry you forgot those glasses.
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
Well, it's non-fat.
Got any money?
How'd you like that gum?
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
So...
She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
George?
That's right. Hey, George.
Serenity now. Insanity later.
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
's a great movie, huh?
George.
So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm?
Hey, George!
Well, if you don't want to...
Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.
Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?
Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)
Hi.
I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
Kramer, maybe...
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
How you doing?
Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
Maybe I'll mention that to him.
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
You alright?
Well I'm done, should we go?
Buh bye.
Hey Kramer.
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
How about that Elaine today, huh?
So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
(offering packet) Gum?
Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
Anybody see Elaine today?
Hi Jerry.
We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
This place does some business, huh?
Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
