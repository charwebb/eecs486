Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
Anybody see Elaine today?
Serenity now. Insanity later.
Well, if you don't want to...
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
No, it's no problem.
Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!
Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm?
We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
You sure you don't want any yogurt?
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
George.
That's right. Hey, George.
This place does some business, huh?
Hi.
George?
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
I'll run in and get the gum.
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
Hey, she's a doll. (looking at Elaine)
Hey Kramer.
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
What do you think put me there?
I'd like a hotdog, please.
's a great movie, huh?
How'd you like that gum?
Hey Kramer.
How you doing?
Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
Got any money?
You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
You alright?
(offering packet) Gum?
Here y'go.
Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.
So...
Buh bye.
Hey, George!
Hi Jerry.
Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)
Kramer, maybe...
Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
Name tags, hmm?
So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?
Well I'm done, should we go?
She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
