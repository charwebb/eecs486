You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
(offering packet) Gum?
Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
Hi Elaine.
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Hey Kramer.
She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
Here y'go.
Got any money?
Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
That's right. Hey, George.
So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
George?
How'd you like that gum?
Kramer, maybe...
Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm?
Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!
So...
Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)
Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
Anybody see Elaine today?
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
Hi Jerry.
Hi.
How about that Elaine today, huh?
Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
Hey, she's a doll. (looking at Elaine)
This place does some business, huh?
What do you think put me there?
Serenity now. Insanity later.
Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
Hey Kramer.
Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
Name tags, hmm?
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
Hey, George!
Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
Sorry you forgot those glasses.
We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
Maybe I'll mention that to him.
I'd like a hotdog, please.
Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
's a great movie, huh?
Buh bye.
You sure you don't want any yogurt?
Well I'm done, should we go?
I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
Well, it's non-fat.
George.
Well, if you don't want to...
No, it's no problem.
