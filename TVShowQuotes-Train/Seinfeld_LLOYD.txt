Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
That's right. Hey, George.
Maybe I'll mention that to him.
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
No, it's no problem.
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
How you doing?
Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
Got any money?
I'll run in and get the gum.
Hi.
Here y'go.
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
Buh bye.
Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!
Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm?
Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.
We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
Kramer, maybe...
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)
I'd like a hotdog, please.
Anybody see Elaine today?
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
Hey, George!
George?
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
This place does some business, huh?
Well I'm done, should we go?
Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
Hey Kramer.
Hey Kramer.
Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
Well, if you don't want to...
Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
Serenity now. Insanity later.
Hi Elaine.
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
George.
What do you think put me there?
Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.
Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
Sorry you forgot those glasses.
How about that Elaine today, huh?
So...
's a great movie, huh?
Hey, she's a doll. (looking at Elaine)
So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
Hi Jerry.
Well, it's non-fat.
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
How'd you like that gum?
You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
(offering packet) Gum?
Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
Name tags, hmm?
