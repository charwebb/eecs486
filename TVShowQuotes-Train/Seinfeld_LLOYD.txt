We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!
Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
