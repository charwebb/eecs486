Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
Uh, oh, wait.
(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that.
C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!
(pointing) The television.
(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?
(drawn out) Aaaahh.
Hi, son.
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
All aboard in the pain train!
I still thought you could do it.
It's go time.
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
I got married in high school.
Step aside, stringbean.
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
Hello, dough boy.
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
This is Seinfeld's kid.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
(urgent) Call an ambulance.
Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
My dad.
Yeah.
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
What the hell is that?
(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
Okay.
