Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that.
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
