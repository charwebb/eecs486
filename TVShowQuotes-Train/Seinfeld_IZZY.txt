Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
