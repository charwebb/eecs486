That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.
(pointing) The television.
I still thought you could do it.
Uh, oh, wait.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
What are you doing here?
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
Hello, dough boy.
Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that.
I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
All aboard in the pain train!
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
I got married in high school.
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
(drawn out) Aaaahh.
(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
It's go time.
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
Hi, son.
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
My dad.
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
This is Seinfeld's kid.
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Step aside, stringbean.
