I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
It's go time.
All aboard in the pain train!
My dad.
Hi, son.
Uh, oh, wait.
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
(urgent) Call an ambulance.
(pointing) The television.
What the hell is that?
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
What are you doing here?
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
Yeah.
(drawn out) Aaaahh.
I got married in high school.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?
This is Seinfeld's kid.
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
Step aside, stringbean.
I still thought you could do it.
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!
You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
Okay.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
Hello, dough boy.
(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
