Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.
I got married in high school.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
What are you doing here?
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
It's go time.
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
What the hell is that?
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
Hi, son.
Okay.
(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
Step aside, stringbean.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
Uh, oh, wait.
(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?
I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
(pointing) The television.
Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that.
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
Hello, dough boy.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
This is Seinfeld's kid.
(drawn out) Aaaahh.
All aboard in the pain train!
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!
My dad.
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
Yeah.
