You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America!  We are going to rise up against you!  Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?!
Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before?
Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection. 
How DARE you like to me and make me look foolish?!
We'll give you a five-second headstart.  One. Two. 
You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much,  and I think that people all over America could benefit...
You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?!
...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...
Was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people?
Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?
We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to "heighten" certain things to make the book more relevant to people.
Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT!  You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!!
Thank you so much.  Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life.  "A Million Little Fibers" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie!  Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, "How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?"
And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection! 
I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha?? 
Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you!
Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct?
Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!
Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?
What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad?
