When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-
This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.
Heeeyyy.  This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way , then make the required magnetic vibrations.
I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!
No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong...
Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it.
There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
