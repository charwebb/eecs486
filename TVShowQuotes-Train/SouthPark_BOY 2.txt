Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. 
This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! 
Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else.   Knock it off!
Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
I thought I told you to shut up! 
Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? 
Does he live with you at the foster home?
