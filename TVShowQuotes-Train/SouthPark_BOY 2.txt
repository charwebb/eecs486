This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
Does he live with you at the foster home?
Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! 
Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? 
Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else.   Knock it off!
I thought I told you to shut up! 
Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids.
