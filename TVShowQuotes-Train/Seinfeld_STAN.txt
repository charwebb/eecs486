(holding the Mohel back) Hey, hey what's going on out here? You two should be ashamed of yourselves, both of ya!
Here's what you do you bring a lightweight jacket, that way the sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater.
Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck...
..So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we want to ask you.
The most important thing is you help with the bris.
Look at that Jerry, look at that. Sucking, sucking...
You're out, Jerry. You're out as Godfather. You too, Elaine. You're both out.
Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?
You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.
No, no buts. We made up our minds. (turns to Kramer) We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven.
Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.
...And then baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming and my brother who's been videotaping the whole thing turns green, his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out, he drops the camera, the camera breaks, and then, the placenta comes flying out.
Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven.
