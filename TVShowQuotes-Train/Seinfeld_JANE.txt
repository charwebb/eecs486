I don't know what she looks like
hello Kramer (he acts all weird, a la Kramer)
Erika? what are you talking about?
(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind
no there's not enough to spare
It's nothing, George.
What's happening?
Are we almost there?
No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare
Me too. I love cough medicine.

No I'm sorry

she wouldn't stop "help me! help me!" she was insane
I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
oh come on up
what things? What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
no, no, no!!!
it's Elaine
nice meeting you
Yeah, I have some things to do.
I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
I told you already it's very boring you know I think I got a little too much garlic, can I have a piece of gum
What's your favorite?
no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore
Hey, wait a minute, I know you
well where is your napkin?
yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?
What is it with you?
What for?
(from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?
I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)
So what if I did?
