well where is your napkin?
look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)
(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either
hi I thought I'd find you here
oh damn
oh I'm going uptown too, you wanna split a cab?
hmm
isn't it too much?
I don't know what you're talking about.
ok so I'll see you Saturday night
it's so nice to meet you (chewing) I look forward to Saturday night
it's Elaine
what are you talking about?
I don't think so.
smell?
what?
no there's not enough to spare
oh how does this thing work?
nice meeting you
yeah
Jerry told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately
(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore
What is it with you?
So what if I did?
No.
Erika? what are you talking about?
well maybe he's feeling better
No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare
hello Kramer (he acts all weird, a la Kramer)
I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me
No I'm sorry, I can't spare it
ok
I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind
I sell paper goods you jerk
oh come on up
no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
no, no, no!!!
Are we almost there?
Yeah, I have some things to do.
well ok I'll see you later,
I don't know what she looks like
what things? What are you talking about?
(patronizing George) I'm sure it is.
I told you already it's very boring you know I think I got a little too much garlic, can I have a piece of gum
What's happening?
Hey, wait a minute, I know you
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?
she wouldn't stop "help me! help me!" she was insane
I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)
well I need mine (looks at her watch) oh god loot at the time, I gotta get to work
Me too. I love cough medicine.
It's nothing, George.
Oh that is too bad, what a shame
