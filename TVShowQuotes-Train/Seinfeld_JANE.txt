Oh that is too bad, what a shame
yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?
it's so nice to meet you (chewing) I look forward to Saturday night
I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)
No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare
I told you already it's very boring you know I think I got a little too much garlic, can I have a piece of gum
Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
Jerry told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately
(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore
I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind
(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)
she wouldn't stop "help me! help me!" she was insane
I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me
no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
oh I'm going uptown too, you wanna split a cab?
(from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?
