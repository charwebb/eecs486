(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either
(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore
(from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?
look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)
Jerry told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately
I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)
oh I'm going uptown too, you wanna split a cab?
well I need mine (looks at her watch) oh god loot at the time, I gotta get to work
it's so nice to meet you (chewing) I look forward to Saturday night
she wouldn't stop "help me! help me!" she was insane
I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind
No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare
I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me
(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?
I told you already it's very boring you know I think I got a little too much garlic, can I have a piece of gum
Oh that is too bad, what a shame
