Where's the ladies' room (Kramer points her)
No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare
Yeah, I have some things to do.
No.
(from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?
What's happening?
What for?
it's Elaine
it's so nice to meet you (chewing) I look forward to Saturday night
ok so I'll see you Saturday night
I don't know what you're talking about.
yeah
(patronizing George) I'm sure it is.
oh come on up
Oh that is too bad, what a shame
Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)
So what if I did?
well I need mine (looks at her watch) oh god loot at the time, I gotta get to work
Me too. I love cough medicine.
I don't know what she looks like
Hey, wait a minute, I know you
hmm
well ok I'll see you later,
she wouldn't stop "help me! help me!" she was insane
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
No I'm sorry
I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either
Erika? what are you talking about?
what things? What are you talking about?
what are you talking about?
I sell paper goods you jerk
oh I'm going uptown too, you wanna split a cab?
smell?
nice meeting you
I told you already it's very boring you know I think I got a little too much garlic, can I have a piece of gum
oh damn
I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me
It's nothing, George.
No I'm sorry, I can't spare it
I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind
yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?
no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
hello Kramer (he acts all weird, a la Kramer)
no there's not enough to spare
ok
hi I thought I'd find you here
no, no, no!!!
(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore
What is it with you?
well maybe he's feeling better
Jerry told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately
What's your favorite?
isn't it too much?
(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
