He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair.
It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.
He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
Sure, I fix. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair.
Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.
I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.
(Enzo enters) So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.
