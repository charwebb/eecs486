I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.
Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.
No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair.
He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.
Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.
(Enzo enters) So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.
I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
Sure, I fix. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair.
