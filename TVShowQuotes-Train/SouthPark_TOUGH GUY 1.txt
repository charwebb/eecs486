Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! 
I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?
You guys didn't know that?  Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'! 
Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool.
Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
Whoa, look at this kid's coat.  Ey, kid. What's the matterâ€”you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What?
