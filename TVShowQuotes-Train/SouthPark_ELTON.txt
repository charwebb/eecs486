And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music.
Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.
Then, letâ€™s rock and roll! Or something similar.
So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over. 
I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing.
Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girlYou're soft but firm, and you go well with wineOh oh, cheddar cheese girlCheddar, cheddar cheese girl
Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights,  including but not limited to Asian territories, with a 20% commission from all domestic sales, and sole ownership of any and all publishing.
Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy.  I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend. Wake up, Wendy Smell the coffee...
I really thought I had it this time with "Cheddar Cheese Girl".
Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know.
I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.
I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy.
It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
