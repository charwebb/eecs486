Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
(While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chicks whacked. Were history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things uh, rust-proofing
Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
I cant give you black at that price.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
Right, Koko. That chimps all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
