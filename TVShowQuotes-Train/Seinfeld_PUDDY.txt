(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
Right, Koko. That chimps all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
