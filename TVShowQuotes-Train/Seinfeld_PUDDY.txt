Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
Hey.
Right.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
(waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes.
Not for me.
Paper jam.. Got it!
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
That's right.
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
Go to Hell.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
No.
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
Im with a customer.
No.
Alright, that's cool.
I dont care for that term.
This is Puddy.
Go Devils!!
Look Elaine, be reasonable.
Alright.
We're primed.
Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
Gonna be rough.
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Alright, what did I do?
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
Oh, so youre leaving?
(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
Hey, no way, man.
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
No way, this is bogus, man!
All right, let's hit the bricks.
Hey, great game, huh?
Fine!
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
Oh, like scrump.
Lets finish this up.
Sorry Im late.
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
Let's make out.
All signs point to 'Yes!'
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
What?
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
So what do you think?
Hey, great dip. You made this?
You gotta be kidding, how come?
I painted my face.
OhThats a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
Why not?
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
Arbys.
ELAINE I want to break up.
Good point.
And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
Hi.
Yeah.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
That's the letter 'D'.
(While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chicks whacked. Were history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things uh, rust-proofing
Ditto.
Don't you? Elaine.
Feels like an Arby's night.
Okay.
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
For the most part.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
Theres a mental hospital right near here.
(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
Peggy took a turn for the worst.
Insiders deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
Great. (pauses) See ya.
I cant give you black at that price.
I'm not the one going to hell.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
Yeah, that's right.
It's my new coat.
(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Hey.
Talk to me, Babe.
C'mon, get it.
Delish?
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
Oh, no.
It was stupid.
Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
No I'm good.
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
They're bacteria traps.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
Ow!
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
Ok.
Yeah, I know.
Hey Benes, How are you?
You know, support the team.
I can live with that.
Nah.
Yeah, if you leave, were through.
What?
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
That's what he said.
Yes.
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
I know.
Two and ten, babe.
How ya gonna start it?
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
Hey, Babe.
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
What did I tell you about that?
Not having to do all thatyou knowwork.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
It's my winter coat.
