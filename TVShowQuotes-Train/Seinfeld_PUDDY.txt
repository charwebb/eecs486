What?
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
Yes.
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
I painted my face.
Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
I'm not the one going to hell.
Right, Koko. That chimps all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Hey Benes, How are you?
Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
Theres a mental hospital right near here.
So what do you think?
Paper jam.. Got it!
No I'm good.
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Nah.
That's right.
Hey, great dip. You made this?
For the most part.
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
Arbys.
Yeah, if you leave, were through.
(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
Ditto.
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
Alright, that's cool.
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
What?
I cant give you black at that price.
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
All right, let's hit the bricks.
Let's make out.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
Go to Hell.
OhThats a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
Delish?
It's my new coat.
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
ELAINE I want to break up.
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
Feels like an Arby's night.
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
Yeah, that's right.
How ya gonna start it?
No way, this is bogus, man!
Lets finish this up.
Great. (pauses) See ya.
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey.
Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
That's the letter 'D'.
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
Hey.
No.
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
Yeah, I know.
All signs point to 'Yes!'
Is there a problem?
Two and ten, babe.
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
It's my winter coat.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
Right.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
Yeah, that's right.
Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!
Ok, ready to go?
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
They're bacteria traps.
(leaving) That's right.
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
Look Elaine, be reasonable.
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
Okay.
Hey.
Don't peel out.
Talk to me, Babe.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
Yeah.
You know, support the team.
Im with a customer.
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
That's what he said.
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
Insiders deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
What did I tell you about that?
Oh, no.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
You gotta be kidding, how come?
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
I know.
Yeah.
Ow!
Yeah.
And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
Hey, no way, man.
I dont care for that term.
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
It's a germ.
Hi.
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
I can live with that.
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Oh, so youre leaving?
Don't you? Elaine.
Hey, Babe.
Sorry Im late.
We're primed.
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
Not for me.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
Oh, like scrump.
Why not?
Peggy took a turn for the worst.
C'mon, get it.
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
Fine!
Good point.
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
Alright.
No.
Gonna be rough.
Go Devils!!
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
Hey, great game, huh?
