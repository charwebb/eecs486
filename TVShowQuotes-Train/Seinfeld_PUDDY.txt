You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey.
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
Right, Koko. That chimps all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?
And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
