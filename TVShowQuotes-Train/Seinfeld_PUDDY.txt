Delish?
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
Ow!
You know, support the team.
And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
That's right.
Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
Right.
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey.
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.
Yeah.
All signs point to 'Yes!'
I dont care for that term.
I can live with that.
Feels like an Arby's night.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
Great. (pauses) See ya.
Lets finish this up.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
Yeah, I know.
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
Don't you? Elaine.
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
C'mon, get it.
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
No.
Hey Benes, How are you?
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
How ya gonna start it?
Not having to do all thatyou knowwork.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
It's my winter coat.
Yes.
Oh, no.
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
It's a germ.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
Theres a mental hospital right near here.
(leaving) That's right.
Yeah.
Talk to me, Babe.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
Nah.
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
Let's make out.
Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
(waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes.
For the most part.
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
So what do you think?
Ditto.
No.
Oh, like scrump.
No way, this is bogus, man!
Hey, great dip. You made this?
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
Hey.
Two and ten, babe.
It's my new coat.
That's the letter 'D'.
Ok.
Oh, so youre leaving?
Hey, Babe.
Yeah, that's right.
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
What?
No I'm good.
ELAINE I want to break up.
Is there a problem?
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
Go to Hell.
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
Okay.
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
Alright, that's cool.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?
Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
Alright.
Why not?
Fine!
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
Hey.
Alright, what did I do?
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
Sorry Im late.
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
Insiders deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
What?
Go Devils!!
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
I'm not the one going to hell.
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
Yeah, if you leave, were through.
We're primed.
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
Im with a customer.
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
This is Puddy.
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
Good point.
Yeah, that's right.
They're bacteria traps.
OhThats a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
Look Elaine, be reasonable.
I painted my face.
Not for me.
Yeah, that's right.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Hey, great game, huh?
All right, let's hit the bricks.
Peggy took a turn for the worst.
You gotta be kidding, how come?
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
Arbys.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.
I cant give you black at that price.
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
That's what he said.
Paper jam.. Got it!
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
