Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
Hey, no way, man.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
Hi.
Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?
Fine!
Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.
Im with a customer.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
What do you care, you know where you're going.
For the most part.
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
Hey, great dip. You made this?
Yeah.
Gonna be rough.
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
Why not?
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
Lets finish this up.
Yeah, that's right.
They're bacteria traps.
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
Hey, Babe.
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
Alright, that's cool.
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
It was stupid.
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
Not for me.
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
What did I tell you about that?
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
(waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes.
How ya gonna start it?
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
Right, Koko. That chimps all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Ok, ready to go?
Go Devils!!
Oh, so youre leaving?
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
What?
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
Oh, no.
Ditto.
Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
No way, this is bogus, man!
I painted my face.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
No.
Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
(leaving) That's right.
Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
We're primed.
Let's make out.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
No.
Hey.
What?
Two and ten, babe.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, great game, huh?
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
Nah.
Alright.
(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Paper jam.. Got it!
C'mon, get it.
That's right.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
Delish?
That's the letter 'D'.
All right, let's hit the bricks.
I cant give you black at that price.
Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!
Oh, like scrump.
Insiders deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.
I dont care for that term.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
OhThats a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
Don't peel out.
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
This is Puddy.
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
Not having to do all thatyou knowwork.
Is there a problem?
Yes.
Feels like an Arby's night.
Don't you? Elaine.
Arbys.
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
You know, support the team.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
Okay.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
Ow!
All signs point to 'Yes!'
Look Elaine, be reasonable.
(While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chicks whacked. Were history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things uh, rust-proofing
Go to Hell.
It's my winter coat.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Hey Benes, How are you?
I can live with that.
So what do you think?
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
ELAINE I want to break up.
(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
Right.
It's a germ.
It's my new coat.
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
Yeah, I know.
Great. (pauses) See ya.
I'm not the one going to hell.
Yeah, if you leave, were through.
Yeah.
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
I know.
