(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
I cant give you black at that price.
Yeah, thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys
Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.
Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.
All that calling you, and buying you stuff
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey.
I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
Right, Koko. That chimps all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?
Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. Ill show you the 900.
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
(Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
(Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin.
(Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee
