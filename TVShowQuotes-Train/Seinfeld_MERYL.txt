By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
I didn't do anything with it.
Well, you must have done something with it!
Who is she? I want to know who she is.
I don't know that!
You son of a bitch!
Yes, it is.
What happened to us, Jerry?
You bring your own syrup?
Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
No, it's 15-8.
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
Yeah, me too. I Love you.
Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
I'll get the short stack.
It's in the first drawer.
(sentimental) Okay, thanks.
And a check for my husband.
Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
I was not!
Uh, would you, um...can I...
Ooh, cashmere?
Oh, that's so touching.
Good morning.
Do you want me to go find it?
Well, I give up.
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
I like adoring.
I'm taking him to the cleaners!
Alright, we'll stop over there.
Pancakes.
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
Did I say you were stupid?
Well, goodnight.
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
It was in here yesterday!
How'd you sleep?
To my adoring husband.
