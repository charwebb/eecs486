I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
And a check for my husband.
Good morning.
Well, you must have done something with it!
(sentimental) Okay, thanks.
Who is she? I want to know who she is.
Oh, hi...honey.
I was not!
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
How'd you sleep?
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
Ooh, cashmere?
Pancakes.
No, it's 15-8.
Yeah, me too. I Love you.
Did I say you were stupid?
What happened to us, Jerry?
The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?
By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
You son of a bitch!
Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)
Do you want me to go find it?
Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
To my adoring husband.
I didn't do anything with it.
It's in the first drawer.
Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.
I'm taking him to the cleaners!
I don't know that!
Alright, we'll stop over there.
Oh, that's so touching.
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
You bring your own syrup?
Yes, it is.
Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
Uh, would you, um...can I...
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
I like adoring.
I'll get the short stack.
