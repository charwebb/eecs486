You bring your own syrup?
No, it's 15-8.
Yes, it is.
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)
And a check for my husband.
Pancakes.
The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
Oh, that's so touching.
A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?
It was in here yesterday!
By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
I didn't do anything with it.
Good morning.
Did I say you were stupid?
I like adoring.
I'll get the short stack.
Alright, we'll stop over there.
Well, I give up.
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
Uh, would you, um...can I...
(sentimental) Okay, thanks.
To my adoring husband.
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
I'm taking him to the cleaners!
Yeah, me too. I Love you.
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
How'd you sleep?
Do you want me to go find it?
You son of a bitch!
Who is she? I want to know who she is.
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
Well, goodnight.
Oh, hi...honey.
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
Ooh, cashmere?
Well, you must have done something with it!
It's in the first drawer.
