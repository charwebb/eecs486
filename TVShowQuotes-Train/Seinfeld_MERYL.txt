Who is she? I want to know who she is.
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
Do you want me to go find it?
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
Well, you must have done something with it!
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.
