Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)
Oh, hi...honey.
I'll get the short stack.
Uh, would you, um...can I...
I like adoring.
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
Ooh, cashmere?
I didn't do anything with it.
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
I'm taking him to the cleaners!
Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.
Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
You bring your own syrup?
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
Alright, we'll stop over there.
(sentimental) Okay, thanks.
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
You son of a bitch!
It's in the first drawer.
Well, I give up.
A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
I don't know that!
Yes, it is.
Well, goodnight.
Who is she? I want to know who she is.
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
It was in here yesterday!
What happened to us, Jerry?
To my adoring husband.
No, it's 15-8.
The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?
I was not!
Good morning.
Pancakes.
And a check for my husband.
Yeah, me too. I Love you.
Oh, that's so touching.
