Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
Well, you must have done something with it!
By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
Do you want me to go find it?
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
