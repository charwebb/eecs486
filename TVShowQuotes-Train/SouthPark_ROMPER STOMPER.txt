Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.
It's my leg! I think it's broken.  You go on ahead without me.
Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.
Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Now go on. Get out of here. 
I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game.  Ew, it smells, man.
Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!
Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.
I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. 
Hey.  You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something.
Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will.
I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate!
Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!
Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!
Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. 
No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends."
No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass!
Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!
No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
