You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.

I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Oh!
That sounds awesome.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Good, right?  Hello.
Pam? No!
Yeah.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
Oh my God.
Left.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Exactly.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
Is that another motto?
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
What? No.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
He's not a real candidate.
Yeah, I thought you started it.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
What is Yankee Swap?
Thanks, Charles.
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
That's okay.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Everything's fine.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Great.
I���m sure he���s just nervous.
Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Look at that form.
This is way more than I make now.
Pam.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
No, that's Andy's office.
[over phone] What?
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
We gotta get him.
Yeah!
All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that���s-- that���s decorative.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps]
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
What's up, Meredith?
Alright. Why don't you just-
You knew it.
Look, you have a lot of strengths.
Penny for your thoughts.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Hey.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
Which means absolutely nothing.
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Where did you take that?
Oh!
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Six of one, really.
Okay.
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Yeah.
Which one was it?
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
No, I don't.
Not that, don't...
He didn't mention me, did he?
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Yes.
Alright.
I don't know, I don't know.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Well, your office is behind you.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Yes, it is.
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
Ok.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Well guys with girlfriends don't.
Thank you.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
Oh wow, thank you.
Oscar?
Oh.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
[baffled expression]
Hi David.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
That's not how that works.
[mutters] I know, I do.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
We're going to Utica?
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
Yeah.
That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
Wow. Thanks.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
What is that?
Wow, I'm really sorry.
Okay.
Theater.
Go get 'em.
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Well, you're probably dehydrated.
The empanada guy!
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
They are terrible.
Not gonna change.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
It���s a monkey.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
I don't like that.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Uh...
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
It's getting late.
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Tickets are 250 bucks.
Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
I was gonna go with this one.
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Yeesh, how old is this ship?
Oh, and I get to carry it.
Yep.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
Not that I know of.
Alright.
Why?
Hmm?
Alright.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
After you sir.
No, no, no.
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Andy, where are you?
Nope.
Awww, sorry. Did it break?
Let's move on to the next.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
Now he is saying 'Hi' louder.
All right, I'm taking off.
Whoa.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Yeah, yeah.
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
We can custom make them.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Agent Michael Scarn.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Jonas Salk.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
What?
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Scones.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
What is that?
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Excuse me.
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
Good.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Really?
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
She's never worn these glasses before.
Alright. I will definitely do that.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
Dwight, don't be gross.
Sure.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Thank you.
Beesly, are you threatening me?
You ready?
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
Oh, uh, later-ish.
Uh hmm.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Urkel Grue.
You���re welcome.
Thank you.
Exactly. You can do this.
What was that?
Thanks.
Co-manager, actually.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Sounds good.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
No you don't.
Well, it's what you wanted.
Wow.
Oops. [hangs up]
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Okay.
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Do you mean vibrate?
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Good.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
...in your condo complex.
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
Right.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Ok.
I doubt that they're sh-
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Having a great time.
Was that your mom?
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
I think she's doing a good job.
Uh, Ryan can never know.
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Ok, this is crazy.
No.  Bob, no. No!
Phyllis and Robert.
Good. Please hurry.
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Seriously?
Ok, ok, ok.
Actually, yeah.
Are you serious?
Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Gravel company?
She...
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
That's pretty cool.
Hey, how are you?
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
[to Michael] Will you stop?
Stanley, are you listening to music?
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Oh no, we're just sitting here.
That sounds terrible.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
Weeknights are actually tough just because���
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
I have nothing in common with Plop.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
There's a little more to it.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
No.
The last���
Was it your scores?
So let's have it at the hospital.
Oh hey, Dwight.
You did not force me to do this.
Probably is.
Nope.
And what happens in this one?
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
No, not at all.
Do you want a corn dog?
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
That's good. You know, with the kid.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
Oh my god. That's so romantic.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
All right.
What power?
That was really good, Darryl.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
What is?
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
Ok.
OK, thank you for ... this.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
Hello?
Oh! Goal!
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Really?
Yeah!
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Oh, yeah. She's hot.
Lets just go.
Let's see it. Show of hands.
Hey.
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Hey.
Could go either way.
1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
[picks up phone] Hello?
How is it my fault?
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Oh yeah-
Shawn Marion.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
Don't...
I'm gonna pull the car around.
Dwight tried to kiss me.
Maybe put up some shelves.
Yep.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Yeah, I want to go home.
Thank you.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Total nightmare.
And then you go to school for three years.
Yeah.
No. She wasn't.
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Hey.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
That���s true, yeah.
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Oh.
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Agreed.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Is he you?
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Which one?
Nope.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
Let's Go!
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
Look who���s back.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
Got it.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
And!
Hey.
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
Tell 'em.
You did not know it.
Oh, sure.
And a shower.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Michael...
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Who goes to business school?
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
Why won't more people do that? [laughs]
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
What's going on?
Talk to me.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Ok.
Oh, you want me to be you?
Do you take requests?
Stay in bed!
Uh, yeah, ream.
Three months.
So...
Doesn't matter.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Yeah.  Thank you.
Nope, go back to the script.
Well, then keep it.
Michael, you don't have to do this.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Uh hmm, definitely.
You feel good?
Uh, uh, ok.
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
[Jim face]
Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
You'd slow me down.
Okay.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
No.
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Get out.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
No, I'm not making bread.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
I love you, too.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Wait wait wait, who said that?
Would...
I think you mean a girl's
Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Perfect. [misses]
[over phone] What?
No, no, no, no...
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
What?
Yes.
What?
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Their bread is very good.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Really.
Yes.
You doing alright, man?
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Again.
Yep.
About Julie?
Oh, you don't want to know.
Well, A for effort right?
Animalian?
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
You okay?
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
Oh my God!
No, don't be.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
No, no, no, no, no. No.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Morning!
And a man.
No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Who else is he mean to?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Second line.
Um, no.
You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat?
Your ex-wife?
We should take a look at those surveys.
The mall?
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
What?
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Wow.
All right [high fives Kevin]
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
But, what if?
I miss you.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
I outran it.
What are you reading?
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
I can���t. I have the thing.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
So why did you come in here?
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Groundhog Day.
I have nothing to do.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
You were right.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Punishment fits the crime.
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
Nice. [they bump fists]
Hey!
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Oh, but you didn't.
No, I'm not doing that.
Yeah.
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Hey.
Okay.
You want to just make a run for it?
Maybe we will someday.
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
You can't even do that.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
No.  Thank you.
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
No, actually.
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
What's that?
Oh yeah, did he text us?
What is that, like... five pounds?
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Did something happen Dwight?
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Are you serious?
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Really?
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
Hey.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Hey, Dwight. What's up?
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Let's do it.
[whispers] Is that Nellie?
Here we go.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
Just take the parrot.
And the final clue...
Oh my God, there
[Phone rings] Oh God.
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
[growling] Nice.
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
Yes, you do.
Well, at least I don't have cavities.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
That sounds lovely.
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Hey, how's things?
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
OK, I think I can help here.
You've got something on your nose.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Alright.
That's him.
Hmm.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Toby.
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
All right. I think that went well.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
I just need some time.
Well, he's Florida's problem now.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
It was there when I sat down.
That's awesome.
Dwight, question.
All right.
I saw him two minutes ago.
MmmHmm...
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Workspace.
Yes. They totally do.
Dragging.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Stop!
Oh yeah, I understood.
Nice. Well, what's it all about?
Does Mose have nightmares?
I don't think so.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Ok, Roy?
Okay, listen.
Uh, Michael.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Well, what if I just do this?
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Let's do it.
That is a mistake.
Bring me players.
Really?
Oh, I stand corrected.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
You weren���t there.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Oh, I-
Right? [laughs]
Really? Not Slytherin?
No, can't.
Let���s do it!
That's increadible.
Thank you.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
It is. Big time.
If you could help me out, that would be���
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Talla-nasty', very clever.
Cugino's pizza.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
Okay... [changes back to Glee]
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
Because you���re sitting?
Nope we're not brothers.
[chuckles] He's so cute.
Not bad.
He never called a meeting.
I think I know the problem.
All right.  Then... it's a date.
You're welcome.
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Probably.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
I don���t think it���s-
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
Sales.
Yep.
Yup...
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
So, we should let him go.
You all right? [Oscar nods]
No, I'm not doing that!
That is good.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Wow, hey.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Ah, you know me too well.
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Dave.
You look great.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
What?
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
It's not hilarious, but...
Stanley. Stanley.
Yeah.
Thanks Michael.
Well, the grass is always greener.
A little bit. ... Worth it.
What are you talking about?
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
It's fire.
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
No, not exactly.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Don't open your eyes.
Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'
Mmm...
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
Where's Dwight?
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
There it is.
Wow.
He's a grown man
Sounds good.
Crying?
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
I love you.
Oh.  Like nobody.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Okay, so--
Okay.
We're back in! Right?
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
He envies you.
I'm the one who complained about you.
She'd be perfect for you.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Alright.
How can you even be sure?
All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.
Okay, this was pretty simple-
So instead of working, you want...
Thank you, Meredith.
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
Kevin, do it.
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
Take it easy.
Oh! Lots of results.
That is a lie, that is a lie.
You know this isn't real TV, right?
So what are you going to do?
Dwight, please.
Okay.
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Got it.
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Did you just trademark that...
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
Hey.
Yes.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
The future mother of my children.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
You play? [referring to keyboard]
And... ta da.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
[whispering to Pam] Let���s go outside
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
No.
Forget it.
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Thank you.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Nice job, Beesly.
Uh hum.
Uh, my ex-fianc��.
Nothing.
What happened?
Really for like how long?
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
How are we doing on contractions?
All right.
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
What?
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
Congratulations.
Let's take a look. Nice.
So it's going great, sounds like.
What, seriously? What is she saying?
Freecell.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
Sounds complicated.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Alright. Let's get started.
Well, I work here now.
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Ding Dong.
Maybe poison?
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
That���s kind of an impossible question.
[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'
Mmhm.
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Definitely not. That's disgusting.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Did you say 'she?'
You're breathing very heavily.
It's locked.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
So.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
What are you doing?
No, I....
Man.
Uh-huh.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
Well you gotta figure this out.
Did it!
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Shut up.
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
How many shoes do you need?
Do I have any say in this?!
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
Yeah?
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
What?
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Hello?
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
[expletive]
Did you really?
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
He did pick a good one.
An Altima or better.
Nope.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Okay.
That's alright.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
Good luck.'
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
And that's all?
Oh, yeah.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Okay, back to the old grind.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
I'm just gonna get...
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Actually here for something else.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Stop. What?
No.
Dwight?
Wait, when was this?
Frank and beans!
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
Wait, slow down.
Who was that?
Hey man, good to see you.
Who, Steve?
That seems inconsiderate.
Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk]
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Who doesn't?
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
Oh. Right, that style.
You mean Kevin?
No.
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Okay.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Michael. Michael.
I don't think so.
Alright.
There it is.
That's a guarantee.
Baquette.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
For what?
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Um, what's going on here?
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Wow.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
Nobody's for.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
No.
Okay.
Give the bottle to Michael!
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Right back at ya.
[laughs]
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
What about a gift basket full of cash?
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Mm-hmm.
Uh-oh.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
Oh...
Oh.  Two kisses.
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
I am, too. Let me show you.
We're gonna go get him.
Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
Hey, Andy.
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Why are you telling us this?
That's awesome.
Yeah.
You are?
Pull over, pull over!
I drive a Saab station wagon.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Definitely not.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Can I address that?
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Oh, my God
You ready?
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
And to drink?
Yeah... yep.
Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
Six dollars.
Stanley?
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
Who here heard it from Ryan?
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
Oh, man. Yeah, I can���t do it.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Really?
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
[sighs and knocks on Michaels door]
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
And no one cared.
He can't hear you?
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
I just thought you should---
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
Oh yeah.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
You embarrassed me.
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
I'm so sorry.
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
Totally reasonable.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
What?
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
Yeah?
Yeah, people like me I guess.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah that's true.
Four months.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Seriously!
Nothing.
Michael - [Michael signs] Great.
Yeah, what do you think that's about?
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Yep.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Alright.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Really?
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Good game Meredith.
A place?
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Wrong, for so many reasons.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Yeah. Right?
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Great work Dwight.
Done. Explain.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
Michael, you didn't even know her.
Hmmm.
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
What? What, what, what, what, what?
That���s so great!
Love.
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
That's-
Yeah, she's doing really well.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
Well, I think she has a kid.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Yep. Cool, man.
That's what I thought.
Nice.
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
What did he say?
Right?
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
No, stop it.
Improv sounds great.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Sounds like every other party.
You didn���t force me.
Is there really?
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
You haven't heard our theme, though.
What?
Was in the green group.
We know that.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Hey Pam! How are you?
I thought you had already... left.
Guy's going by. Shh.
Great!
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
I'm gonna go to my desk.
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Yeah, totally you did.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Yeah.
Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
Now you're just being hurtful.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.
Pam, it just happened.
O...K.
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
You're welcome.
Now, were those for the team?
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
A small blonde woman?
Alright.
OK, Kenny.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
OK.
I know.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
Hey.
Right there! [points to Cathy]
... Yes.
Do you?
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
[mouthing] So close.
What was this? [Makes face]
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
And there's my talking point.
Of course I did.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
So, don't tell.
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
Perform a test.
Like a boyfriend?
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Hmm? No.
Is that trash talk from Pam?
Don���t-- don���t-- don���t pole people with knives.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Thank you, Dwight.
[smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing?
Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Hey.
Yes, I���m happy.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
I did not see this coming.
So Pam was right?
Okay.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Just... quit stalling.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Thanks. [both eat cake]
What?
Resent you?
No. No.
Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
And you'll be saved.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim]
And we don't know how.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
It's going to be alright.
All right. And cider.
Yes, I... Do you want to...
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
No.
It���s Okay.
[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
Hey, you have a second?
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm gonna say fifty.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Pro-- no favoritism.
No. What party?
Whoa, whoa.
Easy.
Ok.
Yikes.
But you're leaving...
Okay.
I guess.
Nothing.
Those flowers are nice.
You writing your name over there?
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
See?
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
And you didn't fail those things either.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Mmm-hmm.
What's up, Hef?
No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
OooOK.
Hey.
Pam.
Wait, what?
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Yeah.
She's engaged.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
Any luck?
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
Okay.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
And I took it right back. It was like...
Ayyyy!
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
Good-bye.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Michael.
It's not on your desk.
Well, that was quick.
Only two hundred dollars?
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
Okay, okay.
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
Absolutely.
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Hmm... Five.
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
Hey.
And what happens here is-
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
That's a great idea.
What do you mean?
Dwight, Dwight.
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Are they looking at me?
Okay, so we're good.
Which we are.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
I know, I know.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Just tell her the real reason.
We���ll talk about it later.
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
I'm sorry? Pam.
Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Aw, thanks, man.
Seems like a nice enough guy.
Yes?
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
Mmm-hmm.
Where'd I put what?
No.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
[to Gabe] Is it?
Uhhh.  Can't.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
This shouldn't happen at work.
We do.
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
Okay.
[clears throat] I am ready.
Which ideally would be me....
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Just...you good?
Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]
You look cute today, Dwight.
He plays piano?
To madness.
You know what? That's private.
Oh!
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
Hey Dwight.
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Now that sounds serious.
That's cool.
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Yes it is.
You���re the best.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
No. It's cool.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Oh... my apartment's on fire
No, I...
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Michael, come on!
The mob, maybe NASA.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
He does?
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
So, none of them?
Pam.
What kind of offer?
She is dating Ryan, I think.
Hey, hey. Okay.
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Thank you.
Right? I was just thinking...
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Hey!
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
To get married.
Thanks!
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Alright, my turn.
No. D-
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
[Pam lights a candle] Wow.
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
A really awesome baby.
I���ll call you when I get there.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
What?
And you are not going to, either.
Okay.
I remember that.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
No.  They're in the conference room.
Wait, that's pretty weird.
Excellent. Go for it.
You have a better idea?
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
Yeah. Super pretty.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
Goggles?
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Yup, I guess so.
Yes.
And you should.
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
Nobody tell him!
Not your birthday.
Ah, hey.
Yeah, you never know.
Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
Is this allowed?
That was really rough.
What?
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
Ryan? A little help?
Come on, man.
See how easy that is?
The torches are lit.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
Hi.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Potential future nonsense.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Who's that?
How do you feel?
So what do you think?
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Oh, don't be that person.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Yeah. Thank you.
No.  You got that backwards.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
You gonna answer it?
Nope, I got eel.
Wow, what are we talking about?
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Did you cry?
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Great. What's new with you?
Let's do it, shoot it.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Sure.
Michael, just go park the car.
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Whoa. Who is this guy?
Hey.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
I have noticed that we--
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
That's nice.
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
I think you mean The Sting.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Yikes.
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
Nothing.
Do I?
[Jim Face]
Anything else?
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Austin Powers.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
Aaah!
OK.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
That's-
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
That was one time-
Why would I wanna do that?
Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
Hey Michael.
No, I didn't.
So weird.
No.
What?
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
[nervously] Pretty good.
Okay, your move.
Okay, you know what?
Oh, yeah
[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Right!
Okay.
Andy, are you all right?
Right.
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
M. Night Shulman?
Um, [gives Pam a look]
Can I get a drink?
Michael, not now.
I did... say that.
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Wow. I think you're bluffing.
Hey.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
I can see that.
Did you just change it to Gollum?
What's that?
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
[whistles] That���s a lot of pros.
Oh, really?
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Oh, that one was good.
No way.
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
Right.
Yeah.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Sorry.
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Wow. [applause]
Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
Just--Just--Hey!
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Stop [sprays Michael]
Right?
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Does my room have cable?
Me, too.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
That's what I'm saying.
No.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
It would look bad.  Sorry.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Did you go to second?
Me neither. Whew.
This is impressive.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
I said I was working on it.
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
Kev's out.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Did my scores drop a little?
Love that one.
Stop it! It's gonna be great.
...Absolutely you should.
Of course.
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Mmm-hmmm.
Katie Holmes.
Don't do it.
That's inspired.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
OK, what are you --
Where is it?
Whoa! What was that all about.
I don't think that's gonna...
Pam.
What���s going on?
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Yeah.
Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Private Room.
What's that?
In well?
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
Michael.
How old are you?
It���s great.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Except pass that breathalyzer.
What?
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
No, I got it.
You're a jackass.
Thanks.
Sure!
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Anybody could have walked in.
Okay.
I think you're right.
Oscar, how are you on that side?
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
It just feels a little bit, like...
[Whispers] Please stop that!
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
Yes, okay. Bye.
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Okay, wait, wait.
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
I just... couldn't wait.
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?
Everything is going to be ok.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Dwight says 'Hi.'
Well, I mean he humped Michael.
No, I really don't want to.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
You wouldn't dare.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Hello?
: Uh, is that it?
What kinda iPhone is that?
Hey, whoa, Michael...
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Oh!
Flooded.
Feel better?
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
I don���t.
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Well I do.
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Yes.
I will grant you one wish.
Don't.
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
You don't want to arouse suspicion.
Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging]
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Yup.
You okay, man?
Nope.
[concerned look on face] You okay?
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
You were right.
Nothing.
So, it's not the dumbest idea.
Actually, you didn't.
And I'm telling you, I don't.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
Uh...
What?
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
So, not prison.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
Thank you.
Is your password Frodo?
What do we got?
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
Screw ���em.
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
Hey, of course.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Michael.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Go crazy.
Okay.
Sounds tough.
Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Wow.
Nope. OK.
Oh, are you firing Creed?
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
I am Bill Buttlicker.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Yikes.
Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
[off camera] Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Of course I read it.
I think you seem distracted.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
That was like, ten years ago.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
Thank you very much.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
Oh yeah?
No.
When did you need that rundown by?
Um... yes.
Maybe you should.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Alright.
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
[to Pam] What?
Really?
Permission denied.
Sales form for you to sign.
Yes.
Good!
It is totally insane.
Alright. [Kelly squeals]
Sure, what's up?
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
To one without a cubicle.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
Not even an exclamation point?
See, that's weird.
Are you kidding me?
Is that not what happens when you're high?
What's up?
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
Really?
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
[taps car] Lincoln.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Oh, sorry gotta go.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Dwight! At least aim it.
OOH! Boom! Face!
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Pam.
Thanks, thanks Dana.
How far away did you think we were?
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Alright, there you go.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
So, really, you're just calling her?
Okay.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Missed the last part.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Really?  Power gel?
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
You got it, you're so close!
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
You all right? You ok?
Hey!
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
That's cool.
Um, bottomless champagne.
How are you?
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Umm...
So you like her?
Now how do you know how it works?
Mm-hmm?
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
Here we go...
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
He knows what he's doing.
Please stop.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin' fun?
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Stop.
Unforgivable.
Oh my God.
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Oh boy.
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
Mmm-hmm.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
That's very...
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Pam?
Get up.
We should probably get back.
Topical.
Great. Let me just...
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
You know what? I could use a little help.
Hey, Toby!
About ten minutes.
What award would you like to give Dwight?
Boy I---
[on the phone] OK.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
I'll try both.
Yep.
Which one... is she?
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
You can write a book about chairs.
I disagree with.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
No, I'm sure you're right.
Do you run the bed and breakfest?
Bye.
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
Thanks Janet.
They're for her to look at, Michael.
Great.
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
What?
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
Oh! Hire a magician.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
Hey.
Hey!
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Oh.
Oh...
Oh.
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
I bet we would.
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Mmum, still wrong.
[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!'
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Sorry. Her day.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Andy!
Yes--
False.  Black bear.
No, you can't fire me.
Nice.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Fantastic.
No, no, no, no.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
Stop shoving me.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Don't call her 'the mom.'
I bit my lip at lunch today.
Easy.
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
So, what is this special project?
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Darn it!
Well we are here now, so let's just--
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
Thank you Angela.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
I think I did a pretty good job.
Ohh...
Wow. Win-Win.
Yeah.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
You still do that thing?
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Mmm...
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Wait a minute, what is this?
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
Please do.
She dies.
You hired him?
Uh, hit and run.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
OK...
At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Went well?
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Oh, my god!
Yes, he is finally nigh.
Isn't that thing huge?
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
Hey, easy, easy...
Okay.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
O..ok. Um..good.
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Oh boy.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
Um...
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Yeah.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Is that your office?
Not a surprise.
Yeah?
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
You don't know.
OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
I get back from work around 6.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]
Ok.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
Right. Let's do some good.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
All right.
I will.
Not Night at the Roxbury.
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Michael?
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Absolutely not.
Yeah?
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Yeah... it.s scary.
Oh, nothing.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Si.
...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
Wait, you alright?
I can't hear you.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Fine. Party pooper.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
It���s, it���s nothing.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
Hey.
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Do you even know what that means?
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Oh, great.
Oh.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Okay.
Good. What? Nothin'
Bye.
Yeah.
Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
How are you doing this?
What about cars?
Oh.
We can order in from Hooters.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
I think you mean smug
Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Such a dork.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Hey, uh David.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
[off camera] ...what?
None of this is time sensitive.
Whoa.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Oh, yeah?
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
OK.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
[exhales loudly] Andy...
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Go get 'em.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
[points at bearded man] Who's that?
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
I'm sorry?
I just-- what?
Michael...
Pam, don't worry about it.
Pam, it wasn't her.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
Wait a minute.
Perfect.
Si, senor.
...It's something to think about.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Inappropriate.
O-Kay.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Ooh! Are you nuts?
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
No. Was that the hard way?
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
What?
Thanks.
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
[leave the conference room to address everyone]
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Perfect.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
I'll just go later.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Oh it has losers.
How do you know it was me?
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Still haven't left the house yet, huh?
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
See what?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
What is happening?
Ha ha. That's hilarious?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
I know.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
Nice job everybody. Great work.
[Jim gets down on one knee]
She said lots of things.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Ummm... no idea.
Not even Harry Potter?
You know, I just think you should know that-
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
[clearly just humoring her] No... way!
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
All right.
Pretty amazing.
I know.  I suck.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Absolutely, will do.
Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
No politics?
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
That's it.
Ok, thanks.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
Hello.
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Stop! Stop!
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
Who's gonna see us?
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
That's great
Well I think Meredith was just --
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
I just wanted to say hi.
Really? Wow... that's bad.
No.
She knew it.
Oh. Any team sports?
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
Really?
No? Come on.
What are you talking about?
Or a gong.
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
No, we don't.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
[to Dwight] Nice.
Yeah.
I gotta get out of this dress.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Why are you- How do you know?
Who is this?
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
[whispering] Hey.
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
Um... why Kelly?
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
All right, let's run it back.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Right? So, uh, let's uh...
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Can I get a drink?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Okay.
That's ok.
Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
Ding dong.
1870's...
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Yeah, trying to quit though.
Beesley, coffee?
[enters room] All right. There he is.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
You what?
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Oh, ok, cool.
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
[looks at camera] What?
Andy--- Ohh...
Well, there is no inner...circle.
Come on.
Have a good night.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
No.
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
OK.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Pam's sales are fine actually.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
We would really appreciate it.
No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Yeah.
Nope.
I am not lying.
Oh, there it is. J1.
What is it?
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Aww, best book?
Ooh... fancy.
We did it.
You will?  Wanna do it right now?
You've been gone for a long time.
Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
That's about it, yeah.
Just do it.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Got to be kidding me.
Yeah, you don't?
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Oh.
That's an overreaction.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
Yup. That's perfect.
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Ok. Bye.
Yes.
Just have Dwight punch you.
Damn.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
Pam.
Oh yeah.  Why?
Yeah.
So... how 'bout let's not?
Oh thanks, Phyllis.
You do?
She's not your grandmother, is she?
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
[laughs]
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
You do?
Let's find out. [starts typing]
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Wait.
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
Courtside seats. Sixers.
Oh yeah?
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Who will be watching the children?
You playing that game again?
Puppet.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
It wasn't me.
Oh.
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
So, where are you shipping your foot?
Is it?
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
What?
Oh, OK.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Oh yeah, definitely.
Yup. I'll trade.
Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Stop right there. I love it.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Okay.
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Still nothin'.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Oh-ho, I am in.
You used my move, didn't you?
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
Oh, um... [A long silence.]
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Alright, thanks alot, David.
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
[laughing] He's alright.
Yes. Right now? Yes.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Alright.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
No.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
Cool.
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Sure, yeah, go ahead.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
And that's when I knew. You?
Yep.
Stanley, please, this is serious!
That's not what that is.
You need to let him go.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
I am not gonna do this.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
Okay.
Nope.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
Are you interested in her?
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
That's pretty good.
Alright.
Right.
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Ow!
Mmhmm, yeah.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
You coming down?
Really?
No, Dwight. You���ll be doing the whacking.
Yeah.  Sure.
Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Good night.
Okay.
Ooh, me three.
This is happening.
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
Come on, man.
Meredith Van Helsing?
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
Wow, that is��� wow.
No.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
I think she will.
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Hey.
Son, you have to talk louder.
It's pretty good actually.
Oh, oh yeah.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Is that it?
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Yeah?
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
A costume?
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
You took the deal.
Essential.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
You're messing with me.
You don't know what it is.
You all right? What���s going on?
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
Which one?
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
Okay.
No.
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
Notify the athletes.
Hey.
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Did you just say you remember him?
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Nope, he means tuna dog.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Right.
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
Here we go.  Here we go.
Yeah.
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Yeah.
Tour, let's do the tour first.
You have a cell phone charger.
I know.
[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
About you two hitting it off.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Oh, um... .I can't.
And I am always busy.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Hey, grandma's back.
Awesome.
Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs]
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Half hour.
It was not rotting.
Oh, yikes.
Okay. Thought people read more books.
Is that Michael?
Hey!
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Right.
No.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Mm!
Cool.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
How are you?
Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
No, not without a 'please.'
Second drink?
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
I will. I will.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Oh, I like you.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
That's also not true.
Dwight!
Who's they?
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
No, that is what I mean.
No.
Mm-hmm.
Wow. Are you that bored?
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
Which is you.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Nice job.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Good to see you.
Oh, great.
Ha ha ha.
S'ok.
So...
You know her name.
Hey, how is... Toby?
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Great!
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Yeah, we all really...
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
How's that gonna help you?
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Nellie
Yep.
Ok. Remember Spider face?
Hey, how's it going?
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
Oh, I don't know.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
What are you doing?  What, stop...
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
And that's not the same.
Really?
Yeah?
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Alright.
Hi.
[snorts] Ew.
All right.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Yeah.
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Right?
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
We should switch seats in order to...
You sure?
What?
Mm-hmm.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?
Leave.
Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
Shh.
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
I get it.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
Okay. Sounds good.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
Catching butterflies.
No. We took a walk.
Oh, tell him I say hi.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
Thanks.
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
No.
Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
What are you doing?
All right, good catch-up.
Yeah?
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
Wow.
I dunno, it's on
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
Wow.  You look--
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
So you're not doing it.
Thanks, Pam.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
Do you honestly believe that?
What are we doing?
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Oh!
Thank you.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Shh!
I think she's awake.
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
Interesting, what's that like?
Because you've solved zero cases.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
All right.
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]
Ugh.
No way.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
So?
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Sure we'll go.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
We're going to the hospital, Michael.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
It's the lever on the side.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
Copy that.
Pretty sure everyone heard that.
Not much.
Yeah?
Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Mmm-hmm.
Wait, what?
It has been, yeah.
That's what I want.
What was that?
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Okay, Dwight��� Dwight��� Dwight, Dwight Dwight!��� uh���
Silence.
Hey.
Is that off again?
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
[looks around room nervously]
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Getting my wife a week off from work.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
I just feel like we're gonna fight.
Hey.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Nothin' much what's up with you?
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
I don't know about, love...
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
[enters abruptly] Dwight.
You haven't done any of the research.
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
Aah! Ow!
Five.
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Right here.
Uh hmm.
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
You set the bar so high.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Is that really what you think?
That's because Mark's my roommate.
Oh, my God.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Oh, loves it.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Who was driving?
Okay, don't be gross.
Allergy to... the desk?
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Yeah.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
Yeah?
Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.
That's... not okay.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Hey.  What's up?
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Everyone knew some of it.
Fraud.
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
I deserved that.
Definitely Grandma.
Nice try, this is ridiculous.
Yup.
Dwight.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Please?
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
OK, I'll call the
[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
No.
[sighs] Gross.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
No, you chose yourself.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
And of course, classy.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
What do you want?
Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
That's nice.
You have a walking buddy.
Oh!
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
Closing ceremonies.
Big deal.
And, um...
All right. Good to be back.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
It's a real handsome duck.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
You gotta have sex with a woman.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.
Yes.
What's up?
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
Wow! There it is.
I don't think you had to.
Oh, hi.
No, uh-
Prove it.
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
Nope.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Bye.
All right.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
But ..
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Hey.
Awesome, right? [leaves]
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
Aww.
Yep.
[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Just steer more now.
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
How'd you get gum in your hair?
Okay.
Oh... oh!
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
What kind of pizza would you like?
Okay.
I'm... leaving on June 8th.
You just had a rebound.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
How did those get out? I'm sorry.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
You can't do this.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Caleb!
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
You're not, nope.  Nope.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
I didn't... no.
You know, man, it's really you're call.
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
Perfect.
Smart.
What are you doing?
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Mosquito.
Me, too.
Hey.
Nah. Might as well do it now.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
How are things?
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
What are you talking about?
Your mom.
Okay.
[behind Dwight]: OK.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
Right. It's city and country combined.
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Uh--
You watched it.
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
What?
Andy.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
That's a common mistake.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Hey David.
Wind.
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Ok
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Oh. Is that like your new thing?
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
Okay, okay.
Yes. You don't love Holly.
Well...
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
That's not what I meant.
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Umm, hmm.
Good.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Be honest.
I love it.
You all right?
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
[whispering] Would you please stop that?
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
Mind if I join?
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
Oh.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
What does Level Red mean?
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Yeah, right.
What?
Oh, thanks.
You should take up a musical instrument.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
Productivity?  My numbers are good.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Well, congrats.
Dwight-
I'm irate right now.
Flowers.
[to camera] It's going really well, actually.
And in this case...
How much time do you have left on your break?
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
Can I go?
What? Yeah, right. As if.
First of all, hi.
Six on seven.
What?
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
I guess I will swallow my truth.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
No.
[whispers] Let me get that for you.
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
Hey.
No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
I understand that.
Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
Pam?
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
I'm sure it's fine.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
What is going on?
I am.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
Nice.
Great, yeah, good.
As opposed to...
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Blonde.
No.
Yeah, but I don't smoke.
Shoot.
Still no.
How many L to a K?
Did you murder someone?
You did approve it?
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Nope.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
Kevin Costner.
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
[on phone] Andy?
No... I think it's a great idea.
And that isn't weird?
I'm sorry.
I'm probably never gonna see you again.
What?!
It's fascinating.
Uh... [looks at Pam]
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Yeah.
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
I don't... I don't think so.
Michael, I'm just trying to --
Absolutely, yes.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
No, why would you think that?
Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
Um... What's in the bag?
Wow.
You got it.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
No, no, you saw through me, great.
I'll use that.
Yep. You're being replaced.
That would be great, thank you.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Nope.
Uh, it's in the lot.
No, you're making this up!
You are?
Oh, OK.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Wow.
Exactly. It happened in Big.
Right... That's good.
Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Yeah.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
I think I got it right here.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
I must...
Conference room everyone.
Hey!
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Hey, Kev. How you doing?
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
So, next interview has to be better.
Can't do that. Unsanitary.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Okay.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
Oh yeah?
Okay.
You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
You look great.
Okay, I'm not doing every number.
Right now?
You like it?
Stop. Dwight, stop.
Good one.
I knew it, I knew it.
Yeah.
We could put that in orange juice.
The other volunteers.
Hey, sorry everybody.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Is there anything --
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Split the difference?
Wow.
Nice. Third book?
Very cute. [holds out the phone]
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
We're gonna get him.
No.
True. Meredith.
Oof. ���Infertility.���
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
Ah, definitely blue.
See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!
What are you doing?
Wow.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Dragging sticks.
I didn't sign anything.
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Whoops.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Oh, wow. So cute.
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Thank you.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
No. No. Definitely. It's ..
Yes, nice. Good word association
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
That's all right.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
Yep...
What do you think of Kelly?
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
You did do it?
You bet.
I don't-
If everyone would like to see proof.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Perfect.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
All right.
Hey, come on.
Wow. It���s the end of an era.
I'm not.
Nope.
All right. [smiles]
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
But you���re saying there���s a chance.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
All right.
Thanks.
Yes.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
So, the situation is the worst.
Obviously.
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Or zipadeedoodaah.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
You shouldn't be talking about that.
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
All right. Take care.
Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
Till Death Do Us Rock.'
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
[to Pam] Hey.
How long have you been a man?
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Oh boy.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Second.
Who doesn't love that?
Yes.
When did you go there?
Don't beat yourself up.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
What���s that?
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Thanks.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
What do you know about boobs?
No it's not.
Sure.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Why not?
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
Alright.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
we good?
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Okay, I���ll do it.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
No thanks.
No, that was unbelievable.
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Yes.
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Oh, uh, no. Could-
Excuse me?
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Ok.
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
This is dangerous.
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.
Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
What about you?
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
Yep, okay...
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
Ahhh.
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Gosh.
That's exactly what Wallace told us.
So then, why didn't you do it?
What? No, no, it's not a vote.
Hi.
What do we have here?
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Thank you, thank you. OK.
I'll do it.
De class���.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Yeah.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
You know, it was one day.
That���s not it.
Really?
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
That���s funny.  Ok.
I have new baby pictures.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Hey.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
What's that?
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Big day.
Nope.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
For a lot of reasons.
[answering phone] Jim Halpert.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Welcome back.
OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
I���ve been in here for 20 seconds.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
Unless you think he can���t handle it.
Yeah, it's a golf text.
Yeah. Bye Pam.
Mind control.
Birthday.
Oh, I thought it was your mom.
Pop-up?
Tuna?
Probably just Kelly.
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
I don't think we need opposed.
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Also good.
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
It's really good to see you, man.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Dwight, should she be our manager?
[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
What?
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Right.
Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
I think Stanley just coughed.
That's OK, we're good.
No, that's not what I-
Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]
How much time do I have?
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Ponies.
I'm not talking to you.
You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Oh, would you look at that.
I'm trying, yup.
She's amazing. This is very exciting.
[on phone] Hold on one second.
There's a table over here.
Yeah, why did you?
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
Really was.
Why is that, why is that weird?
Gross!
Alright.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
I thought it'd be funny.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
Thanks.
Okay.
See ya. Nice girl.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Okay. You don���t need my help?
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
I wasn't here that day.
Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
In the picture, are you high?
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Am I going down a road?
No.
Who is it?
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Okay, done.
Fair question.
Take it easy.
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Yeah, bigger actually.
Wish us luck!
Alright, I have my wallet.
Hey.
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
He's gonna throw up.
Oh man. [laughs]
No, we're good. Thank you, though.
You're writing something?
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
Well, you're driving, right?
Okay.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
And a dart board.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
Really?
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Oh, god, nature, please.
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Whoa whoa whoa!
Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Alright.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
Dwight!
Okay.
Hey, you got a second?
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Did I? I don't...
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
A...hot chocolate tea
Assistant regional manager, yeah.
Obviously.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
Uh huh.
What's in here?
Careful.  There is no inner circle.
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
You must be out or something.
Sure.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
That's cool.
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Yeah.
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
No, that wasn't fun.
I think you should do it. That's great!
Michael, did you say anything?
You want music?
Oh, great.
Because my car broke down.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
that's great.
No.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
[claps] All right.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Yeah, you can.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
I'm on minute six of this message.
No, you're not.
Oh, no, absolutely.
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
-I'm just gonna watch.
Oh, my God. Please.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Ok...
Today of all days...
Now, you listen to me, sir.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
No, not at all.
Dwight come on, come-
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Hey man.
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
What?
Best prank ever.
You mean on a weekend?
Wow. [heads toward the conference room]
Mmm-hmm.
Show him how to use it.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
If this doomsday device goes off...
Sure. Look at you!
Dwight!
We're gonna stay.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Ok, sending.
It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
Um, oh man, I don���t actually know.
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
Did you go to first base?
Don't-
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
I did, yeah.
5 dollars.
Whoa.
Yeah, uh, well.
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Which would be me.
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
I can always kind of win at roulette.
You all right?
You gonna wish me luck?
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I didn't forget them, they're right here.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Right.
Go.
I can't.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Thanks.
I'm on the phone.
It will be Angela.
Green walls.
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...
You have to make the decision.
I'm coming.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
Holly, will you marry me?
Agoraphobic?
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
You know, try sending them another invoice.
I made a sale.
No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
No.
[disgusted groan]
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
What?
We are doing worst first dates.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that.
She's engaged, um... to me.
You got it.
Conference room?
Really?
Yep. [shuts door behind him]
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
All right.
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
You want to talk about it?
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
That doesn't exist anymore.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Yeah
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
How?
When do we want it?!
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
Wake up. [sprays Dwight]
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
All right. Name.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Thank you for choosing me.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
How much did you pay for it?
Do they call you that?
um��� I mean-
Yep.
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Trust me.
He definitely stole my iPod.
I know!
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Okay. Phyllis.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Oh, no, no. No.
What does that mean?
Oh... Good.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
...and paper.
Killer nanorobots?
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Um...
Not as good as you.
So, how you holdin' up?
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Mmhmm.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
No one.
We can't figure that out.
Kelly!
Could, keep that down.
That's not the point.
Yeah, I am too.
That���s all right.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Not at all. It should be Dwight.
What do you mean?
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Wow. Alright. Can���t wait to meet her.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Alright. Great. Thank you.
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
No.
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Wow.
Hey Dwight.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Captain Crunch.
No, Pam.
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Oh you did?
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
That sounds fun.
Fantastic.
[hands David his papers] There you go.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
[knocks on door] Hi.
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
Merry Christmas Dwight.
How old do you think I am?
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.���
Absolutely not.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
Hey, it's snowing.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Yep.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
What?
What?
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
No, it's not.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
No, really, what���s going on?
Mmm.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
Hey, can you go to IM?
Michael, don't.
Do you want to play-
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
You got it.
I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
Wow.
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Huh.
Is he OK?
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
You're starting your own paper company?
No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or���
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Great.
What?
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
It was an away game.
Yeah...
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
Okay, let's go.
[to Pam] Wait for it.
Hey.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Beardy?
Yeah.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Jackpot.
Ok great.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Hey.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Hey, hey, come on, language.
Absolutely not.
Haaank. Is that you?
How so?
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
[On phone] ...W R K.
He's not a part of this. You know that.
Wow, this is my lucky day.
That's it.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Uh, Kitchen.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
[to Cece] You want a giraffe?
Is-
Well, you seem to have this under control.
All right!
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
Hey Karen.
Kev!
Yeah.
Are you serious?
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
What a great year for the Dundies.
Really?
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
You have no idea.
That's the Christmas spirit.
My bad.
Chicken, hot dog, burger.
I miss that.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
[to camera] Just��� so weird.
Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
That's not okay.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
OK, I'm going back to work.
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Great.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
I think she wasn't wearing a card.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
It's broken right, he can't...
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
I���m not doing the Presentation.
Yep.
That was a great idea.
Oh, no no.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Got it.
Michael, no...
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
Ow.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Eight months?
No.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
You got it.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
I know.
What are you reading?
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
I did. It was inconclusive.
All right.
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Nope. Baskets have it.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Yeah... maybe.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Our fake winnings
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
What?
Oh.  Let me get it.
Oh-
Yeah. ��Thank you. Thank you.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
All right.
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Jim Halpert.
What?
What?
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
You wouldn't tell your mom?
Because it's a surprise.
Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
Perfect!
I don't know what you mean.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Hey.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Okay, what's going on?
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
Um, sniper rifle?
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
I���m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Okay, great-
Hey.
What a night.
That's it.
Yup.
I think you should retrace your steps.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Wow.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
Tell me about it.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Really, what kind of celebrity?
She was always engaged.
How was your meeting with Michael?
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
What does that mean?
Cute, sure, yeah.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Probably
Athleap.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Okay. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Definitely.
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Seriously?
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Am I walking out?
Boyfriend.
Alright.
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
What'd you do, Prison Mike?
Nice job.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
What did I write?
Pam!
Is that really how you want to get this job?
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Mmm.
What? Pam!
Ok.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
You must be really proud.
I don't know.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Into a lake.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
No? Nothin'?
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
What'd you get?
Hmm.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
What is it?
Oh my God.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Come on.
All right.
Are you alright?
Yeah.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Ooh.
Congratulations!
Hmm...
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Good one.
She's... high-maintenance.
I have no idea.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!
Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
Hello? Hello?
What?
Wow. [cup tinkles]
No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Puerto Rico was awesome.
Can you give us a hint?
Oh, okay.
Howard Cline?
What do we want?!
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
So, this hot chocolate thing.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
That is weird.
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Oh great, I have to cover?
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
There's the charm.
No problem.
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
[holds up card] This one's a map.
That's what who said?
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
What!?
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
...which I guess I'll be taking.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Okay.
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
Hey.
Nope, not doing that.
Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
[baby voice] Hi.
Ready?
Yes, car seat's right there.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Oh. Um���
All right? I���m gonna wait.
Hey.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Come on. He'll listen to you.
Sorry. That was a family emergency.
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Love you too. Bye.
Ok. Good talk.
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
All right, all right. Okay.
What?
Here we go.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Ok, great.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
Thank you.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Okay.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Louder, son!
Nobody!
What? What?
You want a birthday pie?
...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]
Oh.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Thank you.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
What?
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
You don't even drink tea.
Love it.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Uh, I heard it.
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Ok.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Done.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
What's that?
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Yup.
Lousy Picture.
I'm gonna grab her, okay.
Okay. Roy.
No, thanks.
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
Then take a different way home, man!
Okay.
OK.
Bye, Dwight.
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Dammit Dwight!
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
[looks astonished] Ohhhh!
Fireball!
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Hey.
Okay. We���ll, just forget it.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]
Got it.
[to Dwight] Are you serious?
What's up?
Yeah that's great. Great.
Is that him?
I just needed you to know. Once.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
Is that you singing?
Yup.
Well, we're really happy.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
Mmm-hmm.
Kev, have a good weekend.
Kelly, you know what...
You gotta be kidding me.
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
That doesn't matter.
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
They���re terrible.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Okay.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
I know. It's very cute.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Let's start with the wildcard.
Yeah.
Cece!
Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Aww, nuts. [laughs]
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
It's hard to tell so far.
All right. Did he hit you?
Jerry.
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
Done, right?
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
But what have you learned about her?
That's fine.
Yes, absolutely.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
Yeah.
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Yes. Yeah.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
I'd go with that.
Come on.
I actually know a sex model.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Wow, that���s���
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
No, I didn���t notice anything.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
Yikes.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Do you?
See you.
Eww.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
I tried. He will not listen.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
Hi! [Awkward]
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
It is going really great.
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
Wow.
[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.
So what is the problem?
Okay.
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
Oh��� okay. Where would we go?
Okay.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
To waiting.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Can I have a raise?
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
[pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
You just came up with that.
Let's... eh... see ya.
Dwight! Are your legs broken?
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
What's that?
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Ooh.
[gives Dwight a high five] Great.
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Goodnight, Michael.
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Really?
Not now, Toby, my God!
Oh, I'll walk you out.
Which one's this? Perfect.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
I just-
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Pam, will you marry me?
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Oh no?
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Nope.
Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
Where'd I find what?
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Yeah, I���m here. Are we all on?
So, that's... It's great.
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
I'm not going to Utica right now.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]
Nope.
Oh, come on!
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...
[mouths] C'mon!
Yes, but not by kidnapping.
I'm a drunk driver.
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
[on phone] They hate me, Pam.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
Yep.
I surrender.
Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
No, I don't.
Why?
There they are.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Does he ever.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Hey, man.
You follow him on Twitter?
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Michael.
Yes, I agree.
I got it.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
What brings you to town?
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Too, too loud. Too Loud.
[humming]
Yes.
Don't..
Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
It's fine.
Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
No you don't.
Okay, will do.
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
What?
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
Oh.  Oh...
Come on.
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
God!
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Um...
You will never want to leave your room.
See ya.
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
Nothing yet.
Just one.
Um. He sticks to his guns.
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Just all the - drama.
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Still want that.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Are we in danger?
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
You don't have to lie.
[stops the watch] One second.
Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
Yeah?
Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]
Umm, Michael.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
[continues working]
Why?
A formal warning... [chuckles]
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
I wouldn't understand or a secret?
True love's kiss.
Lucky us.
I'm not-
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
No.
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
Cool.
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
Oh. Hadn't noticed.
Aww...
What are you talking about?
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
I know.  I love it there.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Yeah, we'd never do that.
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
Mm-hmm.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
Cathy, go.
Hey, you got a second?
What are you doing here?
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
We should go on a double date.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Yeah. Okay, maybe.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
You sure?
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Whoo!
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
But you just met her.
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Didn't we kind of start it?
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Just keep him awake.
Ah! [Harry walks in]
[while sighing] I suppose I am.
Okay.
There's like ten green ones.
Duh.
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Thanks Meredith.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
So Andy is in rare form today.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
Wow, that's a lot of keys.
I got it.  Alright.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
[shakes head]
That's amazing.
As a hostage.
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
Big Red Paper Company?
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Andrew.
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hmm. Doubt it.
But he did, right?
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
All right, guys, stop.
[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?
Right.
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Hey guys, what're we talking about?
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
A formal warning, seriously?
No, no, don't do anything to them.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Why is she here?
Sure you don't want the teapot?
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Not much what's up with you?
Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?
Okay.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Okay.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
[shaking hands] How are ya?
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Sure glad you're back.
Yeah. I have a question for you.
What?
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
I think you're under-thinking it.
What?
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Not my favorite, but...
Oh, they're my client.
Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
Hey.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Did ya?
Mm-hmm.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
Oh.
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Hey... What?
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Alright...  Hey, did you change?
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
Where'd you get that?
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Mm-hm.
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
No, she's not.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
Ok, I said average.
See you tomorrow, Dwight.
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
Well, is that it? Or?
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Hey man.
Can't believe no ones thought of that.
No.
Do you speak Spanish?
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
I, ah...
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
No, that's him.
Okay.
All the time.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
Four months.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
What?
I liked you better when you were the temp.
Thank you.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Most apartments these days have like three.
Yeah. Totally.
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]
No, no, no, Stanley.
Oh, wow. But, um���Oh, I get that.
Hey, how are you and Darryl?
Umm... sure.
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
She could put the cup right there.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Yeah?
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
Right.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
You know that���s���
Have a good game man.
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Definitely can't do that.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
It's not my favorite...
Andy... is having a
Go get 'em.
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
What is happening right now?
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
No! No!
Did that
Microgement.
Nope. No.
What's that?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
It's my own fault-
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
This rundown better be really good'?
Hey.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Yeah...
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Do it.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Yeah, yeah. Totally.
Well, that's--
[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Hey.
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
Um... it's in Maryland.
Hey.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
This is great.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
OK. All right.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Dwight...
So what's your strategy for this race?
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
I closed it!
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Okay, man, easy.
Dead goose.
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Okay.
Oh, the best.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
Robert?
Hold on one second.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Two minutes...
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Are you a cocktail waitress?
What does that mean?
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Good to see you, too.
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
[not watching Mose]  More spins.
It says 'workspace'.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Hey, Kelly.
[On business call] Yeah.
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Oh, thank you!
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
That would be fun.
Uh...
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
Loggins and Messina.
Hey, how's it going?
Hi, David.
Umm���.
Have you ever seen a stripper before?
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Nice. Smart.
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
In this car?
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
There is one condition, Michael.
Scared me.  How's the party planning going?
No.
Hey.
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
That's not a good idea.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Oh my God...
Oh, no.
Ok.
Then why the question?
Can't wait.
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
You are bleeding through your shirt.
The new guys called one.
I don't know, dad. I don't know.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
Nice.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Gotcha. Alright.
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Here you go. [throws it over glass]
We were.
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
-give him to me and... perfect.
Well, there's got to be an explanation.
Yes, let's have a word.
I thought that concert was pretty great.
Good.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
How you doing?
To the shame room! [raises bottle]
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
You really don't have his phone number?
Nice.
What happened?
Good one.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Whoa.
Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
Love it. Keep it goin.
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Nobody asked, Bob!
No, no, no.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Oh
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
She wants it bad Michael.
Uh��� yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
I thought it was a workspace?
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
It won���t budge.
Mm... not really, no.
Uh-huh.
Would you like to be our fourth?
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Hey, David. You got Jim here.
Actually it sounds like you are.
I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
Ten. It was the full ten.
He's a jerk.
So, terrible idea.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
There it is. Alright.
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
I gotta go do this.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Wow, that's not what I meant.
How's it going?
Six. You?
Oh.
Not his mom's car.
Right.
Okay, someone look it up.
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Who's that?
Okay.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
Nope. No dog video.
I'm really too tired to do this.
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
Next stop: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
Can't do that.
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Half.
Alright! Let's do it.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Just check it.
Thank you, accounting department.
I... just... if they speak Spanish.
Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Yes, they do.
Hey.
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Okay. [keeps eyes open]
In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Oh, that's good.
No one should be planking at all.
Don't do that.
No, I don't.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Anna Maria's.
Whoo.
Yeah, that was nuts.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Yeah. Even you.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
I mean... [speechless]
Wow.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
Bye.
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
It was --
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
Oh, wow. That's cool.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
OK.
Stop, stop, stop.
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Toby works here again.
Okay.
No, we've been dating for six months.
... MICHAEL!
Sounds good.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
The next year he really stepped things up.
Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Pam! You can't be serious.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks, Toby.
Really?
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
Phoenix Sun's point guard?
Mm-hmm.
Big day.
That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
You okay?
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
I was just trying to be unbiased.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Bribery. Nice.
I was... mocking.
They think it was Mose.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Umm...
Wait, what? Come on!
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
I don't know what else we can do here.
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
That is a lot of liquor.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
To both these bears.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
OK
Dwight! Dwight!
No, no.
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
Hi.
For this?
So you have the directions.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Lay it on me.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Oh.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
You can't lay down.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
It's okay.
Which Spice Girl?
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
That's okay, I'll do it.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Yeah.
And stuff... yeah.
Well done.
Looks like a red wire.
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
You really wanna bet?
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Ok.
Yeah.
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
How's it going, man?
Yep.
No.
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
What?
Where are you going out tonight?
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Oh no, that would be great.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Nice!
I play.
They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.
Ah.
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
You do?
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
No-no-no-no-no.
Ready?
Yes! So when do you start?
Okay, good then.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Hey, how's it goin'?
I disagree.
Haha...
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
Okay.
Ok.
What did I do to deserve this?
All right.
Okay.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!
All right.
Okay.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?
Can we not?
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Go! Go! Go!
Right, the one from England.
Oh my god. That's less romantic.
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
What?
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
I thought it was a fun idea.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
And then compare.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Dwight!
Hey.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
You got it.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
No.
Both.  They're both worse.
Yes!  Angela!  Please...
Nurse!
Nope. Not guilty.
Where do you want to go for dinner?
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Sorry about that.
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
[answers cell phone] Hey!
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
I can also take 3 people.
Yeah.
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Pink is the red-
Yup. That's exactly what we did.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
I love you.
No, we used to. Now we're friends.
Great.  See you upstairs.
No, like baseball. A baseball team.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
Yes.
Do you really have to do that right now?
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Mm-hm
Sorry, Stinky, can���t do it. Too busy.
What are you doing?
Don't take it.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
You, too.
Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Okay.
I don't want -
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Did you ever see that movie?
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
Sorry.
You a sports fan?
I don't!
Yeah, I did. [they kiss]
What's that?
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
I'll call you when I get in.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Because not everybody knows about the party.
Shhh.
[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.
Sounds good Andy.
Okay... Holly's back.
Bye.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
I'm going with grape.
I���ll take five.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Michael, I told you.
Yup.
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Hey Dwight.
Well...
Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
This one taken? No. Good.
OK. [Meredith leaves]
No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?
That's right.
Elaborate.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
Brace yourself. 3��� 2���
Who, Stacy?
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
The ocean.
Dwight, please.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Okay, I will. [idiot voice]
Enjoy, enjoy.
Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat]
Alright...
Oh, crap. Were those yours?
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
Wow. Oh!
It's not really food, right?
[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
Stop.
You're gonna have to talk louder.
My condolences.
I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
Ok.
So this is fun.
This is all we have.
No, you're definitely the problem.
Mmhmm.
Oh yeah?
No, sometimes its right.
Okay.
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
[in office] Are you sure?
No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
That is me. Wish me luck.
Hey.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Alright. [Andy rolls back]
And how many kitchens?
Hey.
Okay. This is it.
Thank you.
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Hey, do you have a second?
Oh initially I did.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Everybody's birthday.
You sure?
Hey, you don't have to...
[confused] Okay?
Yeah, I know.
It's all gold.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
[to Pam] Really?
Let's give it a shot.
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Michael, I really didn't mean to...
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
Yes.
What happened, did he do it?
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Yes. It is.
Good, how are you?
Six-month anniversary. What?
No.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Competent.
A futon?
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
I think she's okay.
That���s why it���s so clean.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
What?
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
No, I'm not calling Karen.
It's still on a bike path though right?
But you hear the baby crying, right?
Good. Good.
Dwight, come o-
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Yeah.
Ready?
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
Free paper.'
Sure.
Hmm, what?
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
65. Ok, no need to laugh.
That sounds bad.
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Didn't I?
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
No, not more than anything.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Yeah. [Doug walks away]
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
...talk about it.
What's going on?
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Well we all want a good party, right?
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
You'd actually move to Scranton?
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
Hey, Toby.
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
Dwight. Dwight.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
What?
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
You cannot take the fall for him.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Okay.
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
You wanna do this?
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
What?
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Erin.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
I did not do this.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
Thanks Phyl.
Sounded good.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
What are you guys doing?
Night-night.
There is soda inside.
Nope, that's okay.
I can.
Oh. Three nines.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
Sure. That they should do one.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
Hmm...
What kind of car does she drive?
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Rank each person individually?
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
Oh, I can do that.
Yeah.
Hey, how are you?
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
Where are you going?
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
I���m just gonna call you back. Thanks.
Great.
Yeah.
Nice.
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
I'm going to take off actually.
You burned
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
That's okay.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
You can try. That, that might work.
I do remember, yeah.
In Philadelphia.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Stop.
No I didn't.
Stop.  That's disgusting.
And I won't.
Are you serious?  Pam.
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
You know what?
It was.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Yeah.
Oh, great thanks.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
It's all good. Are we all good?
Okay, make a commercial.
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
Can you grow up?
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Oh, nothing.
Hey.
Ooh!
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
Umm, what happened?
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Oh, man, so many points being made.
Did you just come up with that?
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Oh wow, these are nice.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Wow.
Porque es muy rapido.
Oh my God.
You couldn't of memorized that?
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
Nope.
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
What?
All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Absolutely correct.
Good.
Really?
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
And that's what I told him.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Dwight, this is crazy.
Five movies. Go ahead.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
No. Michael. Michael.
Yeah.
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
And Jim will say nothing.
No, I don't think I can...
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
No, I don't think so.
[over the phone] How old's Kelly?
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
I am still in Philly, actually.
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Nothing.
I will do some research.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
I can't believe it was me.
What's up, buddy?
Alright.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
This is Jim.
Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
She's not really my type.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Ohh! Good-bye.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Is there a limit?
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Really?
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
Good.
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
What are your top five cases?
Aw, man.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Okay. And how do you feel?
It stopped.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
What?
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
It's a pen.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
All right.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, it's all right.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
No, because of the promotion.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
Hey.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.
Really.
You know I have to do this.
You called any headhunters?
Alright.
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
That's all right.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Ok, say please.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Anything. You got it.
Let's start with... your mom.
Did they?
I would prefer not to.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
Unfair. When���s my birthday?
No.
Oh, God. [hangs up phone]
[whispering] Thank you.
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
No way.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
And the desk.
Doesn't it?
Okay.
Ok.
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves]
[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]
You're a psychopath.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
I'm alright.
Not really a rhyme.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
Dwight, how's the hotel business?
What's what?
Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
That makes sense.
Yeah?
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Okay.
I don't know.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Too late, Kev.
They're probably worthless.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
I know. And I can���t do it.
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
Three times.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
Yikes.
Hey, Dwight.
Alright. So, tell me all about it.
Space dust.
What's going on?
Hello?
Yeah.
I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.'
Ok, you're on.
[impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Yes?
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
I'm not single.
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
What's that?
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Mm-hm.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Don't..
Hey, I���m in Philadelphia right now.
[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Uh... Not a bad day.
What is it?
Two for two, keep it up.
Alright!
What?
I think you did.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
What are you watching?
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Yeah, I know.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
No way.
Those are the doves.
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
We were robbed last night.
Yeah.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Mmhmm.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
That���s pretty good. I feel safe.
Mm-hmm.
Why would you do that?
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
OK, great.
Dave.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Really?
Okay.
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
[makes kissing, puckering sound]
Oh?
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
No.
Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
Andy, come on.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Absolutely, I do.
How are you, man?
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Yikes. [everyone gasps]
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
Leave the telescope.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
Yeah.
Strongly-painted picture.
okay.
Still decorative.
Hey.
Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
We can go.
KGB.
I'll take it.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Hi.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
[chuckles] You got it.
A- ah--
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
I'm trying---
Okay.  Um... Got you something.
That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Hey.
Ok...that's not...
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Great. Where did you get it?
Oh...
Fine.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
[to Cathy] Sorry about that.
Right.
Damn it guys!
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Phyllis! ��Wow.
You know, can I call you back?
Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
No.
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
What was that?
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
I don't know. Let's break up.
You up for a game?
Hey, David.
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
A what?
And then you just changed desks, right?
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
He's a volunteer.
Wow, simultaneous sale.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
He hit the pole!
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
[interrupting] Volunteer duty.
Showtime!
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Let���s hear it.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Let's go to the conference room.
Okay.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
And what's it's name?
No, thanks. You having fun?
Hey, alright.
Are we even sure that's my file?
I love their sandwiches too.
Andy.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
You're not going to freak out?
But I know how to spell it.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
You look really pretty.
Oh my God!
Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
What do you call it? Schruteball?
You gotta play along man.
I think I'm ready.
No problem.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
I know.
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Someone's in a bad mood.
Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
All right!
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
OK, great.
Pam, play by the rules.
No, was it good?
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
Huh.
Mm, can't do that.
Okay, okay...
���Robert, Hey!��� Exclamation point.
Yeah!
[looks at a three dollar bill]
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
Oh, my God! Wow.
Wow, that's not such a bad idea.
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Whoa, careful, careful.
Do you?
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Why?
Really?
No. We're not.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Right.
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
No. Let's talk for a long time.
One.
No... sport.
Phillies fan, though, right?
Alright.
Sometime today.
No, I'm not gonna call you that.
Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
Yes.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
Let's go.
You're doin' great, buddy!
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Where do I want to go?
Roy said that.
We'll figure it out.
Sure!
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
Where... did you learn all of this?
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Thank you.
I don't know, what?
Well, in an ideal world...
What are the two levels?
Uh-
Okay.
Yeah.
I can't. I just got a manicure.
That's not it.
No...
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
No. Thank you, though.
He welcomes you.
I think we'll be okay.
Dave.
Great.
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
It���s a little, uh, personal.
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Why don't we just go by ourselves?
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
[In staff meeting] See these forms...
The raise isn't real.
Uncanny.
All right.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.
So, none of that tipped you off?
Yeah, yeah.
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
He just sent a text...
Uh-huh.
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Really?
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Nope.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
What's gay-dar?
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Great, thanks.
All right.
Well, I think you look great.
Hey.
Ooh, definitely in my top five.
Gotcha.
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Um, not neccessari...
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Tonight, hopefully.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
It's a lunch thing.
Touche?
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
Keys, keys...
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
So, where did you learn how to play?
[unbelievingly] Okay...
Yeah. No. Good.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Do ya?
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Really.
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
Yeah, I know I should.
Oh, that could be interesting.
I didn't have anything, Jan.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
Yeah.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
[shudders] Whew.
Nothing, just talking.
Okay.
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
Ding dong.
Okay that's five.
What?
The temp?
No way, a 280?
Wow. What have we got here?
OK.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Yes.
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
Wait...
That was, that was a surprise.
Well, I mean.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Hey.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Oh, Dawson's Creek.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
Sally.
Oh. Oh!
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
All right, easy there, grandpa.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Yeah.
OK.
Oh, yeah.
Pam?
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Sure.
Can I change rooms?
Yeah.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Oh, there he goes.
Yup.
It was pretty uneventful, actually.
My God!
All right. Bye.
Big tip.
No one wants to be you, Dwight.
Ok.
I win.
Good!
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
Ohhh...
[laughs] It���s called Ghostbusters.
What are you doing?
Definitely.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
Ah, show me how this works.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
In the bed.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
Uhhh, the street?
���And shove it up my butt.���
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Mmm-hmm.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Oh, she's good actually.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
Pull up your pants.
You knew it the whole time, buddy.
Okay.
Oh, OK.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Yes, yes.
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
So, that's how it's gonna be.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
We have plenty.
What?
So I guess I can't get up.
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
That is not the expression.
What?  What?
[thinks] The friendships.
Come on, get inside.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Right.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
Yeah.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
That's pretty funny.
Yes?
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Oh no.
Why would you start so high?
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
See ya.
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Are you sure?
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
What do we got here?
Yeah?  ...  Oh.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Thank you.
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Oh.
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
You know what?
Yes.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
You buy a purse.
Yes, you should.
It doesn't matter.
You know what? Maybe they just ate.
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Thanks man.
Yikes.
Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
Right. There, first...
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Nope.
Really? You just agreed to that?
Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Why don't... Let's...
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Just about... yup. Now.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Hey, are you kidding me?
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
All right-
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Are you... interested in her guy friends?
Don't think you need the corpse then.
Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.
You look a little worried.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
What?
-Right.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
[over phone] What?
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
Because we���re friends.
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Mmmkay...
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Michael stop.
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
No no no!
Was it?
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Smart.
[laughs] Thanks Dwight.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
Who else we got?
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Glass of water would be a start.
Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Good!  What's goin' on here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
No.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
What'd you do?
What are you doing?
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
I think that's the question that you had...
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Can I have a late checkout?
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Did you feel like crying?
Nevermind.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
You paid for it?
You have a toothbrush.
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
I���m not wearing eyeliner.
It was-
Stop what?
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
I...  Pam, please.
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
Mmm.
When?
What are you doing?
Okay, sorry, sorry.
No, can't help you now.
Ooh.
What?
Okay.
I know.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Yeah. You have fun?
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
Second-in-command to Michael.
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Oh, thanks man.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Lord, beer me strength.
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Uh hmm.
You heard that one.
Can't you do something about this?
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.
That I thought we were millionaires.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
I can't believe how bad this looks.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Okay.
Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Hey.
Why?
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Definitely we should.
Wow, that is delicious.
No, thanks. I'm good.
���..breast pain...���
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
What?
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
I just want it to stop.
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
Maybe. Thanks.
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
Is there some evidence?
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Oh no. I was just -
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
I don't know if I can.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Ferris Bueller.
Robert.
Wow! Congratulations, that���s a really big step.
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
You're good... you're good at sales.
