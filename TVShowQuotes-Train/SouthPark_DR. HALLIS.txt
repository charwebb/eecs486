Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.
Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.
However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.
Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?
Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much. 
If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?
That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.
Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?
Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.
Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.
