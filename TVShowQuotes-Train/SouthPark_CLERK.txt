Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat. 
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was.
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 
You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.
...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?
Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.
Take a number and wait with everyone else! 
Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
What?! Why the hell would they do that?
Damn it!  Just like all the other returns! 
Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?
Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. 
Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. 
Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?
That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?
Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.
Would you like a window or an aisle seat?
I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.
Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 
Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.
