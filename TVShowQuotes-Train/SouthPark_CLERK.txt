Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 
Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. 
Would you like a window or an aisle seat?
Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. 
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.
Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat. 
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. 
I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 
That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
Damn it!  Just like all the other returns! 
What?! Why the hell would they do that?
I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?
You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.
The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?
Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?
Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.
Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.
Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?
Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
Take a number and wait with everyone else! 
Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was.
Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.
Take a number and wait with everyone else.
Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
