Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat. 

Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?

And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.

It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.

I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.

Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.

What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.

One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?

Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you!  Stanground, brah!

No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!

Would you like a window or an aisle seat?

Take a number and wait with everyone else! 

The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 

Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-

Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.

Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.

All right, you guys look ready to zipline!

Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. 

Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.

I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.

Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.

Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.

The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?

Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.

All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.

Take a number and wait with everyone else.

Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!

Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?

Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. 

This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.

Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.

Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.

Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.

Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?

No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.

That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?

There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.

Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.

Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.

Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.

Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.

Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?

Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.

Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?

Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.

...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.

Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.

Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. 

Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.

I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?

Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.

Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?

You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.

Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.

Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?

Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.

Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 

Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.

What?! Why the hell would they do that?

Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?

That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
