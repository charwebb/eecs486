Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?

Damn it!  Just like all the other returns! 

Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 

No! I won't take it back!

You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.

Well, that certainly would explain a lot.

We don't take pubes!! End of story!!

Next!

Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.

Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-

Take a number and wait with everyone else.

Finally, a fella that talks some sense.

I can't give you your money back.

Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?

Can I help you sir?

No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!

Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you!  Stanground, brah!

Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.

Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.

Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.

All right, you win.

Sure. New state laws say it's okay.

What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.

Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.

The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 

The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?

Take a number and wait with everyone else! 

Alrighty, let's see what kind of-

Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!

Hello, can I help you?

Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.

...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.

Yeppir! 

Have a good flight. Next, please? 

And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.

All right, you guys look ready to zipline!

Ma'am, is that your son over there?

No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.

One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?

Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?

This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.

Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.

Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?

What the hell are you talking about?

Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?

Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.

Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?

That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?

Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was.

Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.

Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes.

Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.

You wanna return it?

We don't take pubes!

Why not a thousand "Livin' In America"s?

Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?

I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?

That'll be six dollars.

Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.

Tourette's Syndrome?

I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?

Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.

Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.

Can I help you boys?

I don't know who you mean?

Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.

Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat. 

Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.

Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.

Why? I don't know. I was drunk.

Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.

Alright, our last zipliners are here. 

Welcome to Zeebod's Toys

I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. 

Would you like a window or an aisle seat?

Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.

You're going to New York alone?

Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?

Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?

Yeah.

There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.

Oh...

Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?

Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. 

I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.

Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.

What the-? 

Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. 

All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.

Hey. What do you think you're doing? 

AAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Who are you?

Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.

Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. 

All right, that'll be 6000 credits. 

Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.

Damn it!

Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.

Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
