Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San Jos√©, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!
Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.
Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. 
The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?
And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!
Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! 
Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children.
You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.
Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?
Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.
Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!
All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way. 
Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.
Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. 
Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!
Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.
No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.
We're the group singing for the "Save The Rainforest" summit tomorrow?  Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now.  Children, do any of you speak Spanish?  Don't you dare! 
You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir  where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.
