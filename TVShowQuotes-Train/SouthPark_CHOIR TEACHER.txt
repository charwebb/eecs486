Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?

We're the group singing for the "Save The Rainforest" summit tomorrow?  Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now.  Children, do any of you speak Spanish?  Don't you dare! 

So, who wants to join the fun??

Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.

All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.

Excuse me?

Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!

Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.

Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.

Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. 

Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!

Oh my God!! 

Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!

Eric, SIT DOWN!

Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.

And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.

Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way. 

Stanley, what is it?

Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San Jos√©, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!

Who's not?!

Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.

Jesus Christ, is he dead?! 

The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!

Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.

Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!

Yeess!

Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?

Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! 

Eric, what the heck are you doing?? 

Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children.

Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?

Eric, sit down!

Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-

Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.

Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!

Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.

Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.

Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. 

No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.
