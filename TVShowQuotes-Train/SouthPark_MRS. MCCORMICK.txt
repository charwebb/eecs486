Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!
Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!
But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.
Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!
Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!
Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.
You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?
...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.
You've gotta tell me what happened to him!  You have to know something!
Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. 
You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff.
Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.
They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?
Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 
Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. 
He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.
Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.
Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)
Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.
Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? 
That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.
Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what are you going to plunge?
And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 
My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.
I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!
That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! 
Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. 
Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!
Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.
You saw him, didn't you?  You saw my boy. 
Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner. 
Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.
I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.
Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.
I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
