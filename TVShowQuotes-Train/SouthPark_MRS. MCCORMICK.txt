Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)

What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!

Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!

You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!

Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!

I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.

Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.

Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.

You've gotta tell me what happened to him!  You have to know something!

...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.

Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.

That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! 

Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.

Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.

Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what are you going to plunge?

And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?

Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.

Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.

Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. 

Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!

Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.

And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 

I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!

I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!

Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!

That's right, I'm a little drunk.  You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy.  My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.

You saw him, didn't you?  You saw my boy. 

Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. 

Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.

Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff.

Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.

He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...

That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.

You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!

Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.

But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.

Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?

We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 

Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!

They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?

Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.

Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. 

Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!

Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.
