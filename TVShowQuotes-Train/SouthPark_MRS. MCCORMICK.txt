Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!

It's happenin' again! 

It's my house too, you no-good loser!

Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.

Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.

Fifty-second.

Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!

What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!

Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind.

Yup, it's for sure!

Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!

Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.

They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?

We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 

Are you alright, Stuart?

...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.

Yes?

That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.

We were?

Aaaaaaah!  AAAAA! 

Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!

Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.

Kenny ,

Ohohohh!

Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.

Make a sweater?

Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. 

Grab a lot son.

He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...

What should we name him?

That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! 

Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.

We didn't, either.

But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.

You want some more hot water?

Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.

You're hoggin' it all, asshole! 

Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.

There there now. 

Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? 

Stuart, don't even get started! 

You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!

I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!

Kenny, GIVE IT UP!

You saw him, didn't you?  You saw my boy. 

Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.

I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!

Oh, alright. 

Our little angel, yes.

Will he ever recover?

I'll do it again! 

Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff.

Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. 

Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?

What's the matter?

Let's say grace. 

Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.

Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.

How much is all this gonna cost?

What happened?!

Amen.  Does anybody have a can opener?

Okay, let's dig in. 

Uh-I don't know.

Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.

That's right, I'm a little drunk.  You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy.  My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.

My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.

Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)

Stop it!

He did? When?

Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. 

You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!

I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.

Okay, okay!

And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 

Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.

I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!! 

Good job, Kenny.

Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!

No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!

Kenny, it's time for dinner!  Kenny?  AAAA!

I'd like to see you try!

My babies!

Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!

Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.
