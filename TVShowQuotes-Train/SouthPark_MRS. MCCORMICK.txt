Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!
Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
You've gotta tell me what happened to him!  You have to know something!
My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.
Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.
Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!
You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.
Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.
Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!
Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!
Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? 
That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.
I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?
And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. 
Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.
Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)
Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.
And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 
Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.
Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!
Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 
Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff.
Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!
That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! 
Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what are you going to plunge?
Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind.
He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
You saw him, didn't you?  You saw my boy. 
What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!
Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner. 
Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.
...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.
Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.
Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. 
Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.
You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. 
Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?
