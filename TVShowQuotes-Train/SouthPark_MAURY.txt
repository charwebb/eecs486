You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. 

Wow, that is out of control!

Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is?

Go on, you're going right now!! 

Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.

We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.

What names do they call you at school?

And do all the kids at school make fun of you?

So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?

So, is it tough being ...different?

You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.

Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! 

Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.

Let's bring her out: here's Chantal!  So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? 

I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?!  Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! 

Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show.

Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.

Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old.

What the hell is this? 

Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones

Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.

Ah, those damned freaks! 

There a problem?

Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. 

Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.

Do they go, "Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing"?

And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?

Do people sometimes stare at you?

Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!

Right. 

Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?

Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.

Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?

You have balls that hang off your chin.

Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-

Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!

Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
