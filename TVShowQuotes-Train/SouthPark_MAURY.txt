And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. 
Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.
Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show.
So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?
Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?
Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.
Do they go, "Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing"?
Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!
You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old.
Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.

You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.
Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-
Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!

Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.
You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. 
Let's bring her out: here's Chantal!  So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men?
