Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old.
Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show.
Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.
Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones
Do they go, "Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing"?
Let's bring her out: here's Chantal!  So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? 
I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?!  Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! 
Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
What names do they call you at school?
And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is?
Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-
Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! 
Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. 
You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.
We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.
Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.
Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.
And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?
So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?
You have balls that hang off your chin.
Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?
We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control.  Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men 
Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!
You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.
