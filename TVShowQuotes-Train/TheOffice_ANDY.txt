Nah. I like my plan better.
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs]
I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
[turns over card] King of hearts.
Come on!
Andy. What���s yours?
Anything.
A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
What if you���re being attacked by a 4���11��� man who is penisless?
[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
Alright! Here we go.
Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
That sounds weird.
Mm-hmm.
No games?
Pause after 'news'.
This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
It���s now or never.
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
Aw!
The bookstore?
They don't know how.
Well, I think down���s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Yeah, absolutely!
[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
Hey, Mrs. California.
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
Yeah.
[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
And you will be hearing from -
I'm sorry, I meant later.
Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Hello.
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
I don't even know what that card said.
[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day.
Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
Hey there. It���s a pleasure.
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
Not a question.
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
Yes! Thank you! Such as?
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
Big day for you.
[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
I... Got... It.
[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?
Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
That's awesome.
I will fight you.
Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe��� you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
Stupid dog.
Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
Not necessary.
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
No, we were really making out in the woods.
What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'
Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
Never cry wolf.
I wanna take you to sex school.
Yes.
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
I am the captain.
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.
Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
Yes!
Seriously?' Are you serious?
Cool.
What?!
Russell, I���m dressed like George Michael.
Jim! How 'bout you?
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
Oh no.
They already have a contract? [Reading] ���Mutually agree to-��� Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
Great.
Ring her up.
What���s the story?
Love you too.
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
Okay.
It's literally like-
Hello.
I wasn't telling you.
Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,
Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
The answer is yes.
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
This is for pleasure.
Bueno.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
Wahhh...
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
[weak] Hi Tuna.
OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..
Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
[laughing] I like tea!
David Walrus, in his native habitat.
Yes!
Steven Sondheim.
I had no idea.
You're not?
So we're just, like, jamming as friends?
[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
I don���t know where it came from.
What was that?
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
You have his email?
Do you like apples?
And it���s getting a little more serious.  She���s never come by.
Hey boss. Got a minute?
[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
How about a little bit of this.
Hey, have you guys seen her?
If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...
Just don���t do the song anymore.
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
Right on.
Good, good. What else?
Of course!
Why don���t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
Ho hah!....oh, shoot.
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
No, that���s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about���
After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
[Darryl runs in slow motion on video]
Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it���ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
I think you're going to like it.
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That���s final.
Fart���.. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg���s asleep.
Is it fresh? [winks]
Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Hey, Danny.
This is kinda time sensitive.
Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
[scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.
But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
Can you go over those options again?
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.
Oh. Hmm.
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
Done.
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
Good.  Drew.
Okay!
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
[throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...
So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.
Is somebody there?
I use the word ���guys��� a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
Do me! Do me!
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who?
Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...
Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.
If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Wha-
[silently mouths] Wow!
Do it.
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
What do you got?
Right. Okay.
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
So, it's a date.
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles]
Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
[passes out hats] One for you.
[in falsetto] Please Mr. President-
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
We won't let you down.
Are you factoring in the��� whole national ���economy���. declining and all that?
Let's go, let's go.
Yo.
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
Stanley, you're suppose to close.
His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
Are you saying-
[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.
Duh. I know. That would be insane.
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
Got it. Then I will call you.
Closet full of mes-
Okay, TMI.
You never told me you were in high-school!
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
What���s this?
People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ���You guys are killing it!��� I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
What?
[singing] You know I can, my man.
Golf.
What do I see in Angela?
Up high.
[at same time as Kevin] I did it.
I wish you well on your quest.
No, I'm good.
Hey!
Ribbit!
Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?
Hey! High-five!
Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I���m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog���had to pull rank.
Yeah.
You are murdering the Nard-dog!
Let us know if you need anything.
Oh! Ah, Megan.
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert���man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how���s the sales doubling ���project going?
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
We have to clean this up now!
Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Ohh...
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It���s going to be terrible.
Oh-oh, come on!
I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
Don���t���don���t���
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
Yes!
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
What?
Gahhh. That's five strikes.
Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
Hmm?
Huh?
Umpf���that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
[drumroll with hands] I��� it���s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice���s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ���I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.��� Smart, right?
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
I���m sorry, what?
Anything.  You can ask me anything.
I do.
Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
Morning, everyone.
Erin go braugh!
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
Yeah Jim, get it out there.
Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
There���s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
Whoa.
Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus' Party in the USA]
David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I���d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
How?
Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it.
No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]
That is a penguin. You like it?
Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
At least until Stanley calms down.
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Thank you, Erin.
Let's just jump in the air!
Well, so what?  Your body's a ten.
Move it!
Which is insanely painful.
Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'
[dances] Whoo! Yeah!
That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
So pretty today.
Erin likes Gabe.
They are already off, my good sir.
It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
That's so beautiful.
Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand]
--sorry, you go.
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
We should think about this���does anyone have any better ideas?
Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
What's up? I got your e-mail.
It was like amateur hour.
If I am not Boner Champ, I don���t know who I am.
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause]
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.
Oh! There we go! Pam?
Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Yeah.
Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
[coughs word] Idiot!
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords!
Uh, I'll hear the other one.
That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar]
[on the computer] You���re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
[nodding towards Michael] The Huntsman.
Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
Whoa--
Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.
I was telling that... I was telling that.
Ha! Knew it!
No.
I���m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it���s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
You were saying you chose me���. There was a reason?
Cause you���re always taking dumps.
0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
Ow.
[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.
Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
Yeah.
Fine.  I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
Well I have the, the blue book value...
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.
If-
Excuse me?
Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk]
Great!
Rut tit doh doh...
Well, okay then.
I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side���s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
B-9.
Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
I was too embarrassed! [group laughs]
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Yeah!
Right-o.
I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don���t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I���m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
What do you mean again?
We're just friends, okay?
Look up here!
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
I know, right?
They didn���t know about the snowman story, and when I told ���em, they were not impressed.
Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
Ahhh... Is that the last of it?
Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
Mmmhmmm...
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!
Of the hourglass..
Hey-o! [applauding and cheering]
Seriously?
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
Dwight we got five strikes.
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
I forgot, a��� a pan, uh ���
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
[song ends] Toby, how did we do?
Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
My maid died.
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!
Mmm, I doubt that very much.
Yes.
After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
Thank you.
It was before, my tech- my technical training.
I am not asking, I am ordering.
Oh...
Wait, wait.
Oh.
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
Cool!
And it was open. And people saw this. And they���re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
Class is canceled, everybody out!
Guess what? Not happening at work.
Sorry, when did you get married?
...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I���ll hold. I���m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
I love to dance-
Okay, all right, all right, all right.
You guys came.  Where���s everyone else?
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
What? Based on what?
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
[sighs] Yeah.
Oh, okay. I don���t want any part of this.
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
Thank you.
You're gonna lose all of our money.
Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
I thought you were in rehab.
With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.
Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
Oh, I see.
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
Yea?
You're the only person who's congratulated me.
That's the family boat!
Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation���s Lisa Loeb.
Just, you sure Clark?
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
I didn't.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.
No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
Just make him stop the freaking bus!
Hi gam-gam.
Come on, get over here.
That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
I want you to print that out for me.
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
It's like a ten minute walk.
That...
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound]
One. Two. Three. Shot!
All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
What?
My nanny used to wear that.
We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
Let's go to the conference room.
Let's not go crazy.
Congratulations.
OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
Thank you.
Yes I can.
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
Really?
Fire guy [makes flames with his hands]
[removes teeth] Creed's going?!
Gosh, I hope so.
Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?
What??
Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
My name is Andy!
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
What do you think?
Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.
Specific shout-out..
I swear...
Thank you.
Andy, or Andrew.
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
Definition.
[struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
Yeah.
That's a racing stripe.
Yeah.
David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
You give up?
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Sure.
You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
Okay! Hope you all learned something!
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
My parents are broke.
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
You're a hoarder. My god!
Are you okay?
Well girls tell each other things right?
[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
They had, uh��� weapons.
Exactly. Help me po��� mouth, Darryl.
Drew.  I'm Drew now.
Then I'll get something too.
But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food.
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
Sorry.
Go away, we're running lines.
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Well-
No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it���s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
Well it's the thought that counts.
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Let's do it.
Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
There���s a mole?
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
He beat the computer.
I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
Coolio.
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
Costume vetoed.
I'm gonna lose 'em.
We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
What's the occasion?
[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.
Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
Don���t touch me.
Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
Hi.
I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
I didn't tell you.
Oh, just backing up and turning around.
What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
I would like that.
I had no idea.
I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hey!
Maybe you're in the ceiling!
I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
Nice sweater.
Hey! Pam!
Took ���em one day.
Yeah, it's a kilt.
For two hours? Really?
Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
Do you know the other state?
Don���t care. Tell me later.
Oh!
What?
Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Very very smart.
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
You know what--- I don't---
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat���am i right?
What?
Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together. [Andy plays video]
Yeah, uh, excuse me.
Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
That���s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete���s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows]
I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Sure? Okay.
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
Oh yeah.
I'm glad you asked ��� Connecticut Casual.
[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]
What?
I wasn't acc-, accusing...
What���re you still doing here?
It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don't let me die here.
[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
My Cornell a capella group.
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
Why can't I be in the club?
I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ���Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas��� Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
Damn it.
Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
[singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
It was?
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
This is great.
So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ���move on���. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
What?
What is it, Big Haircut?
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
Are you blind?!
Alright.
Who'd you get?
Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
Cindy, Cindy.
���ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
We'll use code names.
Are you insane? It���s the Cornell fight song.
[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
I don't care.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
Hey-oh!
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
I'm like a quarter of the way through.
[sings] Time to have a little kiss!
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
Is this Robert���s attempt to embarrass me?
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don���t know!.....I don���t know.
She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.
It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
Oh, really?
I'm punishing them.
Christmas miracles do happen.
You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
Even without an audience you���re still at it.
[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Okay, so I-
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.
I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!
Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
Hey, look at that. Done.
I am gay, and I prefer men.
[chuckles] Addition by subtraction.
[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.
I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
I know who did this....Dwight.
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
Mornin' Jim.
Enngh-
All right!
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael���s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I���m so not prepared.
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
I just need you to know-
Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
[fist pound each other] Totally.
I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
Thank you. [leaves]
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
Yeah, but��� My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
But I just���it���s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn���t���
Right?
You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
Guys?
Hey-o!
Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
Oh, I do!
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
And where did you go?
[to Michael's camera] Hardcore Parkour!
Nifty!
You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
What?
What are you guys talking about?
Have you lost weight?
That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ���action.���
You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
Please!
I'm thinking about it--
I don't know how you got there.
Hey-o!
Yeah, come on in. I���m just on hold with another talent agency. It���s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there���s more. 251. 252. I can���t even keep up!
Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
I stole it!
You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
Oh God. Come on!
Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ���Banjo at 0:19 is aight��� Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
I... don't know. Help me.
They just didn���t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
That���s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Oh, its on.
Oscar, it's not that hot out.
Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
All right, who���s next? Nellie?
Can you get the phone?
How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
Fine.
Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
[eyewashes again] AHH! AHH! AHH!
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
[Angela kisses him] Hey-oh!
Hey.
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
No what?
Woo!
Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
Better a cappella.
Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
Alright.
I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
Maybe we have a plan for you?
[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
Oh, there's an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
Yeah.
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'
Everyone please, just-
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
Well I don't see that happening.
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
You never update it.
Stop saying my name.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor���.vanilla?
Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.
Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Ah, come on!
I heard it from Erin.
Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
[looking at Angela's costume] Approved!
Really?
Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
Kay.
Oh. Hmm.
As in...
No, I did not.  Was that any good?
Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
[opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.  We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.  Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.  Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider]  Yeees!  [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted.
That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
I���m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
My whole life is a booger bubble!
Sure.
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
This branch, I'm the regional manager.
No.
Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
Jim?
Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.
Does it hurt?
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?
What are you going to see?
I know.
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
Yeah.
[sings] What is love?
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
Sha-bow.
...Ryan...
[laughing nervously] Yes.
Chicken pot pie.
I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
Hey, Erin.
What are you thinking?
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
I call foul, sir.
[at dump] It's freezing out here.
No that's... not how it works.
Message received, little soy bean.
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
All right, all right, all right.
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
Ok.
It really looks great.  You did a great job.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we���re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
That's completely backwards.
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area]
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
Surprise! [laughs]  It's from everybody.  $15 value.
Aaah! [everyone clapping] So good!
The male is a funny species. We don���t just tell each other how we feel, that���s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ���Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don���t want you to leave.��� You say something like, ���Hey, Andy, you���re making the worst mistake of your life. You���re not talented.��� Well��� right back at you, Darryl.
But you're calling me a liar.
Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
You think I can do better?
Rehash���
He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!
Yeah, right?
Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?
Yeah, I killed.
Fascinating.
White, because it contains all other colors.
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]
You do have a fantastic basement.
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
Will end completely!
Yes.
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?
Yeah, yeah.
Um, nerthing?
Jamie!
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
[British accent] No.
How is that relevant to anything?
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
Mmmhmm. [leaves]
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
[standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.
I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
[drinks hand soap]
What about a cat eating man food?
If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
That was fun last night.
No drama. Ok.
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
No.
Ok. [signs paper] thanks.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
[confused] Yeah.
I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
We're gonna do it outside.
[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Oh.
Dwight.
All good, Santa.
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
Yeah, how do you play?
Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
Right?
No.
Is it true?
Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
Then the basil will be fine.
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
Oh, baloney.
Tuna... You're completely sane.
Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
Mushroom caps.
Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.
Not at all.
I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo���hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing��� no traditions!
Alright, I'll tell Dwight.
Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves��� [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
Well, but it-
It was hilarious.
Oh my god.
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
Yes.
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
No, that's ridiculous.
Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
No.
Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.
Get out of my way, Jim!
Your text said 911.
Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
That you���re learning a made-up language from HBO���s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
Then I will write it down.
My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
Think we'll find him?
Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.
[snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine]
What are we gonna do about this?
Yeah. All right!
[to Dwight] Where you going?
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Did you check the vending machine?
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
Are you...
[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
And you're fired...
And the Christmas party.
Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
I don't have any ideas though.
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
What's up?
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
Hey!
A year.
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
Do you guys like apples?
From 'Cheers'.
Oh, okay...
Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
We're taking a picture.
[laughs]
Yeah.
What can't go on?
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute 'break a legs' or 'I still love you' type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
No. I don't.
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
You did not, Kenny!
That was not a fail.
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he���s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he���s hard to love, but did you know that he���s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
For four more days.
Kevin, you open it up.
Do you know why you never heard of it?
I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion���
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Yeah. D for Andy.
Hey! Where did you go?
And one for you.
What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Let me know what they say.
Huh!
Take care Julia.
What?
By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
Hey, boss man.
What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering]
[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
Yes, yes, yes!
No, pause longer.
Roller derby practice!
No way, lady.
What?
Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
Uh, that's not what was-
[with a sigh] Okay.
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
Officer.
Stop just saying that.
Hey-o!
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
Aww, I mean...
Erin!
Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
Dwight why don���t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Thanks, Kevin.
Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
Nice.
Eli Edison.
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
I do.
Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. We are thrilled.
So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
Yeah!  I mean it's a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
This is your���you brought this on.
She's babysitting?
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
Did he tell you how I got the name?
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
NO!  I want names!
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs]
Its��� I mean come on.
What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
The one in the green hoodie.
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
What is wrong with her?
[Group continues chanting ���Fail!���]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants]
We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell]
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
It's on!
Ooh. It's coming down out there.
I���m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
Hundred and twenty points.
I guess it's starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
There what is?
Hi.
Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Thirty-one.
Alright fine.  You know what ��� I guess this place just hasn���t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I���m still going.  And I���m not going to ask anymore.  I���m not even going to look back.  I���m just going to assume that you���re with me.
[doing eyewash] AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
No. It's over between you two.
Now this is called slack lining.
��� yeah���
I, I thought that you would like it.
[hugs Darryl] I���m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Ok.  Erin I think you know I���ve been dating someone.
Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
Do you have a specific place in mind?
Really?
I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.
No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Whoa! What is crackin?
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
Yeah, its where they make stuff.
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
Parkour!
What are you...
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they���ve ever been to me. What I wouldn���t give for one of Phyllis��� classic room clearing farts right now.
Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
This has been a really tough time.
Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
What?!
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
That is what I'm showing you.
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
[shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
Yeah?
[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Bye guys.
Who else knows about it?
Seriously, Angela?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I don't care, so it doesn't matter.
Australian accent...
Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!
Maybe. Only maybe.
That's...
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
Swear to God, hope to die. Now let���s get to work!
How does he feel about it?
It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
That's very generous.
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Ooh I didn���t mean to offend you, and I hope you���ll forgive me because I am very very��� Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
Come on pam!
You don���t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
Who was Cornell's eighth president?
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?
Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
You know your soccer, man.
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
���..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
[through the car window] Kick Wallace's ass!
[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
Jackpot.
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
Say-
Kevin has that lovability.
Not cool.
Yeah, me, too.
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
Here it is, you should draw a picture...
What does this say?
With fury...
Reverse snobbery.
No.
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
Eleanor Roosevelt once said ���the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.��� [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she���s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I���m doing the right thing.
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
Here...
Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
All righty.
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Well, you got it this year too.
Oh! God! [smacks roaches]
Great game, coach.
I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
Oh. Okay.
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
Feel it against your cheek.
Will do, boss-man.
I play the banjo.
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
I���m delivering it from the fridge. It���s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
End the mistakes, easy-
What?
It has my face on it.
Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.
Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
So?
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!
That's a good one.
Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
...So help us out.
What's bad?
That's clever, Debutante.
[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
You were?
Noishe!
Aww.
It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
She probably a t--
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.
That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
Neither am I, it���s already done.  Hah, I���m just kidding, it���s going to take some time.
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We���re 100 percent staffed up.
Mm, well, you used to be.
I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
You broke my heart too.
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
Whoo.
Do you love him?
Who are your role models?
Oscar says ���hi��� all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ���Hi��� ���Hello��� ���Hola��� You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ���hi���?
Where's the concierge?
[applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
Hour forty-five.
I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Okay.
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I���m thinking of. Can you clarify that?
You bet.
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
OF course not.  There���s no magic button.  You have to summon that.
You didn't have to do that.
Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
Yes!
Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
Hey, yes.
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it���s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let���s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
Baseball!
What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
I believe it means mouth pleaser.
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Do you like it?
Oop, got some blisties.
Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
When I was a salesman I could just be like ���Not my job, not my prob. I���m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.��� Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
And your affiliation with Cornell -
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
Of Flatt & Scruggs!
Alright, a plan it is.
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
Sure.
... not what I meant.
No. Not that I see here.
Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
Very cool.
And come and tell me. Doesn���t matter what it is.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
So you had a bad day...
Not guy friends?
Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.
You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]
Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That���s something you can���t take back.
Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
Your wish is my command.
[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.'
Hi guys.
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
Thanks, Angela. You too.
I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
Oh, no.
Good!
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
A little frazzled.
Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
You my friend are in a very close second.
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
Well that's not--
No.  No that was real.
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
No I didn���t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it���s weird that she���s not calling.
Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you���re talking about?
Mm.
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.
Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!
You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
This is combo number seven.
Oh... at least we can kiss now.
Stop the bus!
Yeah.
What did you say?
Are you serious?
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
Give me something!
Hey Michael...
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
You're going to believe that guy?
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
I didn't know you had a brother.
Hey-OH!
Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
I don���t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
Did you tell them?
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
Did you check your... butt?
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
Love the belt.
Well I'll do you one better.
It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
Maybe we could switch instruments.
Well, what do you want?
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Yeah, but I'm number three.
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
Sorry.
What?
Well, technically FOR Andy.
Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Hey Kevin.
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
Hang on.
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
I'm her fiance.
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.
You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
You���re exactly right and you get a point.
Why would that be weird?
We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
Okay.
That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Ah... sweet!
Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...
Night.
[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you���re amazing, okay? You���re obviously gonna be on the show, so it���s someone else���s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I���m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Okay.
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Yeah.
Whoa. Okay.
I know, right?
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
You guys...
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
The fire's shooting at us!
Well-
Did the email go out or���
Oh, oh!
I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
Mm.
Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.
[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
[pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]
Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Nope! [stands up and leaves]
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
What do you got?
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
Ooh, that sounds great.
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
So no?
Might've done. And how��� do you figure?
Okay.
What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
Wow, that's wonderful!
Great!
Angela?
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
...Erin...
Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Oh, thank you.
Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
Now check the style!
All right.
Um Phyllis, who's that?
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
Where?
Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs]
And?
Yeah.
What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
Was that hot or what?
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
In this climate?
And those sand grains are tumbling..
So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
What���s up, guys? Just thought we���d have a little rap session, talk about business���see how things are going? Ahem���
[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ���95. Hey there, um, I���m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here���De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale���uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I���m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
We need you, OK?
A little warm.
[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
Angela Bernard.
[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
Everybody out.
It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
I know, right?
Why? Why? [looks at Jim]
He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
No.
Oh Man! [clapping]
Ehh.
So... how was lunch?
Just close it.
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
Morning.
I'm taking it over from here.
One, two, three, go!
Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
Thank you, David.
Hey... David Wallace!
What are you still doing not at your desk?
Phone's ringing.
Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
Yes! The dude is an enigma.
No, this is horrifying.
It sure seems like he is lying.
then I'll take a table!
We will be team U.S.A.
Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
That is just obnoxious.
Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?
I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
And I'm a director.
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Megan Fox! Come on!
He���ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
Yeah.
Seriously?
Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Thank you. That feels good.
No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
Hey! Tuna! He's back.
Oh, doggie.
Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
Tuna!
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
Well that's not what we agreed on.
I got you health insurance.
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
Is it true?
No, best thing that ever happened to me.
Me too. Hold my place in line.
Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?
Is that right?
I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There���s a review of the documentary!
[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
Sh---
Yeah, even cooler.
Take. That down.
It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.
Yeah.
Ah, OK.
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
Safe travels.
I know that it���s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that���s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.
Thanks Dad���Darryl.
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out ���you suck my nutz��� from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
Great. And Kevin.
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
Is everyone licensed?
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]
Why would that make me a pervert, I -
Welcome back Tuna!
Let���s ink���my stink! [crowd cheers]
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
What would you say?
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
Yes!
Yeah, Dwight.
[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Yes?
Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Oh, my gosh.
Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Hi, how's it going?
What do you think?
Hey, we'll be just fine.
Yeah, if I had my own--
[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.
We had to leave because of creative differences.
Oh, man!
How does that work?
Dwight, anything?
Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
Yeah.
I am calm.
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!
Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Sure thing, buddy.
Oh, God!
I���ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Well, Carla knows.
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
Thank you.
Why did you do that?!
Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
I am so great!
Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight]
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
...That was weird.
I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
Tom Brokaw!
Hey.
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
Darryl said, ���Cool, man.��� He called me as cool man.
Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis' iPod]
All right. I get it.
...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
Covered it up.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
Awwhh, wow.
Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That���s what you did with this trip.
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
I have a delicious secret.
Yeah, what day?  What day?
Thought about it, I'm in.
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
Done and done-er.
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
Oh, and I care why?
Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
That's not why I came over.  I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi.
OK. [to Erin] I'll call you later.
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
17 B.C.
Yes.
Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be���[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ���Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes��� by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith���African American���Mambazo.
J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
Woo!
Einsteins! Great work.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
Yeah.
[looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
Later man.
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven't had a very hard life.
Yeah.
Those are fully staffed as well.
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Walk until you hear the beehive.'
Hi!
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
When what? [clears throat] When what?
...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
That���s my signature song.
Yeah, OK.
[waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks!
-ket
That's low, Tuna.
...my girlfriend's back!
No way!
No. What?
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line.  Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
I'm sorry, nine days until what?
Hey.
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.
Everyone.
What can I do for ya Hoss?
No... I didn't steal your joke.
���.Stanley..
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.
[coughs sentence] Nice comeback!
She's nature's bounty.
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling]
There he is!
Yeah. Um line 1?
Thornwood Wholesalers.
Rut ti doh doh...
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Do the next one.
[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.
Really?
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
Are you taking your med-meds?
Hm?
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
You sure it's saber?
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I���m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
I'm still the boss!
Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
Are we scaring them straight....?
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
Nn no.
I'll go with you Stanley.
Surprise! Your new crew.
Oh.
Okey dokey. [knocks on door]
Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing]
Uh, did you need something?
The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
Yeah, some of that existed before.
That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
A baby what? A human?!
Haha, what?
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
Uh, dream. Goin��� with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn���t that right, Jim?
[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
Ah... [stammers]
Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'
I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol��� family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
So bad!
[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
Well played.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
Well that's Dallas.
Michael, you're up.
Okay.
It was like a security blan-
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
Well... there's no instructions.
Surprise!
It���s just business.
Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.
Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
[knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
Yeah, it is actually.
So... here's the thing about infidelity.
So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]
Saving the best for first!
A madhouse.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Sure.  I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.
[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]
How do you not have a toothbrush?
[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.
Oh, really? From what, two to four?
Um.
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Mmmm...
I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call���Dwight���
[in character] Hey there young lady.
Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?
[laughs] Totally!
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Website check please.
OK, keep in mind, it���s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points���.or best offer.
Hey.
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
It's over.
People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.
Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.
No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Football cream. Grr!
I mean... [Pam giggles]
Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
Should I change?
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
Dwight!
Awesome.
I did stand up comedy once.
Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.
You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
No.
Yeah, yeah, it's great...
Edgy impressions.
[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in]
And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
I changed my mind. [gives Nelly papers]
Wait, what?
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...
Well, ah, ah...
Where's Dwight?
Beer me!
What?
Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.
Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
See what I mean?
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!
Hello Kitty's for girls.
Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
It's so good to meet you!
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
Yeah!
But who
Oh, come on!
Yeah.
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
My first order of business: accept.
Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.
Yes!  Can anyone do those?
No. I���m a rogue.
Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
Sure.
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
Then I'll make you.
Ah! That���s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
What's going on?
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
[buzzer noise] We were looking for 'kitten.'
Maybe like a year ago...
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar���s friend walks up] Not anything.
I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
Alright, I've scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
Into the mic, sweetie.
Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Whoa! Mind blown. It���s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
[making pencil imprint] Dammit.
It's like a haunted disco.
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It���s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That���s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
She's like, probably a tutor.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
Dr--- You can call me Drew.
Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Kevin, I appreciate what you���re trying to do.
Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
I didn't even say what it is.
Clutch cream run, bro.
I'll call you back.
You're welcome.
[points to self] This is the Nard-Dog.
One came up.
I'm in it to win.
Who else?
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
How could I not see it?  You're so right.
AHHHHH!!!!!!!
You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.
[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
How's it going over here, guys?
Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
We couldn���t crack it.
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women���s soccer, no?
Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
Whoa, fire!
[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
These cookies are fine.
Hey Kevin, what are you doing?
[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
What? No, why?
They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
Oh my god.
Yeah. [clapping]
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
...and an American Express green card.
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ���er rip. What do you hate about this place?
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
Hmm.
I didn���t do anything any of you wouldn���t have done.
You wanna go?
I���m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it���s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
That's not you.
I have some good ideas...
It is not just coffee.
Make a donation.
Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
What happened to old salty?
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
I'm not asking for one, I need it.
I promise you that I will.
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here?
Right?
For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
Yeah?
Thank you. [hangs up]
Angela, you like lacrosse?
[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
That you're sleeping with Dwight.
Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
What happened in there?
I am dying of lovesickness and horny-sickness.
My ass is only so big, I mean I can���t do this everyday.
Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what���s up? Back in the small pond?
What?!
Ow! Get off! Get off!
Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.
I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
Dwight's grandfather was a���[is interrupted by Dwight].
I know, I know that you're proud of me.
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
Aw!! Way better a cappella
What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
C���mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
Look, it's not that I don't want-
Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
In a minute. In a minute.
I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
What?
Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
This is your big day. Come on.
Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Not helping, tuna.
Right, it feels strange.
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
You're choking him!
Yeah?
[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?
Super romantic.
It doesn't matter.
I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
And this is where I will record your sales.
What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
You're being an idiot get..
Why would you say that?
Sixty bucks a session.
Yeah, right?
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
Agh! Son of a bitch!
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
We're done. Erin and I are over.
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
Why would people say that?
Through the use of force.
You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
Mobsters are!
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
WHAT?
No, I do not.
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
Okay, Tuna.
Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I���ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
Nope. I have made up my mind. I���m really sorry.
Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
Twenty points.
Thirty minutes!
Even the fact that I'm gay?
All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say 'aye']
What's up?
Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]
Hey, fellas!  And... lady.
[on computer screen] Ah, what else? I���ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
I can make myself cry.
Did Donna tell you that?
What?
We're losing cloud cover.
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
What?
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
I didn't see that movie.
Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don���t���it just��� I owe it to myself and my future fans.
No!
[Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!
Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey...
Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
Atta boy Clark!
No time to chat.
Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
Yeah.
Mmhmmm.
I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
You just use whichever one is sitting there?
Which one did you see?
Ah, OK.
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
You're being a Thomas Oregon!
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I���
What?
Hmm.
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
Did you maybe tell them that or...?
Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
Everyone! Changed my mind again.
Yes!
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
Thanks.
Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
I'll use my hands on it.
..The camera don't lie!
Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Isn't that your money?
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look]
Jim?
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it���s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...
Fine!
I mean, it's pretty broken already.
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Yeah.
My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
[softly] Take that, kid.
No way!?
I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
Of course.
Hail to the chief!
No, this is my time! You don���t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
No, no, no. I���m wearing makeup.
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
You know Darryl?
Aw, that���s cute.
Dwight...
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
Banana cream is the first to go.  We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
Hey, what���s goin��� on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young���uns?
After you.
This conversation is over.
Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ���.Confession: I don���t know what I���m doing.
I found my calling.
Whose your favorite iron chef?
That���s a crazy amount of points.
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Just, please...
I'm saying no.
Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?
[gets up] I'll do it.
Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
We called Angela?
[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
Dah!  Come on!
So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
What's up, man?
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.
Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
You're running from the problem.
Angela!
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?
Are you sure?
[to Susan] Cameras...
Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
Baby, don't hurt me!
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Uh...
Ooh, she's counting again.
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes���
Dwight.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Like a month ago.
All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby���s thighs]
can you believe this guy?
Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car]
Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]
Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
Water.
Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
You got it.
Oh... [Kelly laughing]
Five to six hours?
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
which I will not be a part of-
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man���s signature solo is his for life, okay? That���s group policy and you know it.
I'm doing this for you Meredith!
Thank you!
Partay. Room 639.
You got a minute?
Right-o.
[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
Yes I will.
It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
Oh boy. [follows Oscar back to coach]
Hi.
Lot going on guys. What���s happening?
Did you mean a real date?
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz.
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
It's, I mean.
It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
No thanks.
[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
Books! Excellent, Jim.
Ooh, gosh!
I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
I think I should go the hospital.
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
What are you doing here?
Fine. But I could have.
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
Darryl is a jerk.
Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
I have to pick one of those?
OK what?
Close it.
But off the record, I'm kinda confused.
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that���s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I���m gonna thank people.
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
You didn���t let me finish. That���s not fair.
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
[going for it] Alright.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
You don't have a toothbrush?
[claps] That was fantastic.
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Cool.
Whoa.
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.
That's how it works!
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
Guys! Guys! Guys!
Nice to meet you.
Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
What is all that?
Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
You would?
So.
No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
[softly] What a coincidence.
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
Wha...?
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
You do?
Gentleman. [walks away]
Exactly.
Consider it nailed.
Oh thanks.
Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
See you later.
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
She's taking us back to first base.
Who is it?
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
Carla Fern is not just an actor���s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?
[swings] Dammit!
I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you.
What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
Well it���s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
I said are you ready TO PARTY!
My bare hands.
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor]
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
I���m going in there.
Thank you. [steps into conference room]
What?
All right, yes! It's a deal.
I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.
Yeah.
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I���m going to refuse to take it.
So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]
I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
Dude, that is my face!
Yeah. It's pretty close.
Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
Oh, whew!
Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
[chuckling] Okay.
Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
[relieved] Yes!
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
Totally.
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
Rut ti doh doo doh
And as such, I come to you...
[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]
I bought these.
K
That brilliant little bitch.
Um, what are we talking price wise?
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
Oooohhh.
You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
Hey Darryl.
What?
Closing time.
The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
Okay.
We're one in a million.
[deep voice] Listen, I don���t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I���ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
Thank you.
Do you believe in me?
Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
Okay.  Let's do it.
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
Yeah.
This guy looks like a real deviant.
I���m sorry ��� I���m with a very important client. It���ll have to wait.
All right!
Hello.
Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!
I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
Say what?
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
Okay, thanks.
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Okay.
You sure?
That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It���s like a festival of poo.
Oh! [laughter]
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Stop doing that!
Okay.
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
Yeah, so, I���ll see you on the red carpet. See, that���s how it works.
Hey, boss.
Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I���m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
Absolutely.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?
But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
Have a good meeting!
These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
A-team.
I don't want to talk about work right now.
Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
Express love, magical.
What, is it because he's black?
No, that's...
Then... what are you saying?
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Put the game on hold everyone.
If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
Okay.
I gotta go talk to her.
I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
Yes, I do. Phyllis.
Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Thank you. Yeah,
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
The cost of doing business.
Yeah!
It's my ear.
Down the sides..
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
Well...
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
Still waiting on that check.
[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
You know what? Go. Have fun.
I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
Dwight!
Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
Let me get a picture of you guys.
What?
We kinda nailed it.
Who says that?
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]
Ok.
Come on, just do it.
Sorry?
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Kaaw!
From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Why would anyone frame you for that?
Here���s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam���
I will try.
I insist.
Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
Uh...
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
Because you suck.
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Mmhmmm.
Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
[over phone] I am so horny.
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
Yeah, it sounds like it.
Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
What are you gonna do with all this time?
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
Yes! Yes.
Oscar
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
No.
That's a lie.
[with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.
Yeah, it was. That���s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
Yeah.
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
No, it���s me, Andy!
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
OK.
Really?  That doesn't sound right.
Of course there are!
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
[taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.
We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
Already? This, this guy is persistent!
You up for a chest bump?
Where is my FREAKING phone?!
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
I accidentally ate some seahorses.
Yeah. Name another.
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Seriously, you guys, ask me.
Yeeeeah.
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
We promised we���d never say goodbye.
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
Death of a salesman.
[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
You humiliated me in front of every body!
No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se��or Loadenstein.
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don���t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
Good morning, Pam.
[grunts] Augh.
[on phone] Hello.
Uhh, beg your pardon?
It doesn���t include headshots.
Are we rotating seats, or?
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
I left my cell phone in my car.
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
Hmm.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
I really 'Schruted' it.
Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
Bro, I do that all the time.
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Oh, God.
And you sold it to Jan too.
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
No, no, no, no, no.
Are you playing for the other team?!
Oh, we got this!
Wha, it's-
Go Einsteins!
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
That's not what I had in mind.
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
You got it.
I don't care either way, so....shut up.
You have to.
Sweet.
You don���t like the hats?
This is gonna look so awesome!
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
That's actually 'Master of Ceremonies' Bernard.
Yeah.
Yeah. Right.
I think we should.
Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
My new girlfriend.
Yes!  I'm in.
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
No.
Thank you.
All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
Actor?
Cool, thanks.
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
It is? I'm sorry.
Yeah, which one?
You're such a liar.
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
Oh! Seven new comments. ���The guy at 0:19 is hawt!��� [typing] ���Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!���[reading] ���He's not hawt, he's gay.��� [typing] ���Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.��� [reading] ���He is hawt!��� See, thank you, that's more like it. ���He is butt.��� God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
I don't think so.
Hmm. Very true.
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
No. No, no.
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
He does your laundry?
Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
Pffft.
Closing time
Right?
It's the world's only international sport! [sits down]
Oh D!
You're right, that is new.
I don���t think she���s dead.
Now?
Yes!
Your hands.
No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.
Mmm.
I'm...  I'm asking you out.
WHAT??
Yes.
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
Uh yeah, look at that.
So like, missionary...
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
It's not... Whether or not, you...
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
You go first.
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.
Bump! I bumped it!
Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.
[looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]
How long has it been going on?
Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
Hey, how are you?
I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Goat���
I can't hear you through the glass
Yes, I do.
[in robot voice] What is going on?
[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
I���ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm���.
Seriously?
You have your team.
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
All in! Whoo!
Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
Wow.
I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.
All right!
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Yes like a chime or a bell...
I don't know.
Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!
Are they from you?
That's really nice, thank you.
Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
I wasn���t fired. What are you talking about? I���m fired up, yes. Guys, I���m���I���m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Get out of the way!
That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Close it.
It's got pheromones in it.
He's alive.  So you're welcome.
Re-suture.  Sutures, yes.
Right. Do you see a clue or...
Yes.
Noishe.'
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
That is so mom.
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
I got mine. They were really good.
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Afterwards at the...
Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
What's that, Stanley?
Question. Where's Jim?
Are you kidding?
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
Charge!
Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
This is what I was trying to tell you.
They sure do.
Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
Don't worry. You're not...
Ok, fine.
This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
He drives an SUV!
Light side.
Bah���I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
[inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour!
Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
Crystal.
...your help. I love her.
[stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.
No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?
No.
No no no no.
[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
It, it's, it's actually just an issue...
On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
Yeah? You like it?
Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
Not my slaves, my ancestors���. Maybe. Probably not.
I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
You look awesome.
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
No! [runs off]
Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.
[blowing air horn] Yeah!
I know, right?
[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Count me in!
Can we talk about this in private?
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
Hmm? Who? Sam?
[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
Heyyy��� let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
Thanks for coming in guys.
What if you���re being attacked by a ��� smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
I don't do drugs!
Yo. Dudeces.
[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.
Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
You said... [makes gibberish noises]
Uh-huh.
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ���HARD ASS���] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
Ha, that's why I wore this shirt.
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...
Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
[Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon'
And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
How romantic is this?
Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
What do you think of Angela?
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
Welcome.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Twenty seconds to go time.
No. It���s a job. Things are going great.
Sounds controversial.
Correction.  It was my idea.
No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
Or both?
No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
Really?
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
No!
Yep.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Monsieur.
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
Yikes!
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
Oh, I took out my lifts.
This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.
This man has a gift!
This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
Hi.
Okay. Robert���s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Whoa!
Ruh duh duh da dudes! What���s up?
Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Walk around apple orchards.
Yeah. No. Well, ok.
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
No I���m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn���t, I���m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don���t like to throw around the b-word, but I���m going to be a huge bitch to you.
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]
Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.
Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
Ah... busted. Yes
[joking] What do I know?
I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
None of your business.
Congratulations to you.
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I���m all for it.
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.
Let me think about it--
Not this time.
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
Baby, don't hurt me.
I���m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
I believe in that.
[speechless]
It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Well, I...
[to Clark] So this is a single.
Do you know anything about physics?
Here for what?
We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug.
That was awful.  Robert I apologize.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
You know, the marmalade sounds great.
Cause that says, that says...
I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
What?
Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
What happened? What can I do to help?
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
Stanley.
Yeah, but here���s the thing. I can���t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I���ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
What? Sorry.
What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
You guys ready to party?
There was a fire in the warehouse?
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
That's not how that goes.
You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.
Who knows?
No, it's in New Mexico.
Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
T-bag bone���
I knew it!
Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
A minute would be cool.
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]
Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down.
No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
Duuudes, stop.
Have we heard of it?
Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
You guys, they're making out.
[signing his name] Andrew��� Baines��� Bernard.
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Dude, you struck out.  They're totally stuck up.  Here... drink up.
WB!
[to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh���.oh boy.
Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.
How next to?
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
These are delicious.
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
I can���t.
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin��� movie star! [kicks trash can]
There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]
Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
Well-
[raised eyebrows] Okay.
Try and keep me from coming!
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
You said your upper back itched.
[punches button] Speakerphone!
...And, Jim.
Why did we pretend like we work here?
Well are you?
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
Who?
What!
Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.
What's up, gangstas?
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
A delicious moment.
You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
I know it's like cricket.
Thank you.
It���s only 6:00. Come on, everybody���s going.
Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Who is the gal in question?
Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
How'd it look?
The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]
Where are you going?
[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.
I didn't know you were going to be here.
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
Hey. What's up?
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
[laughing at something on his computer]
Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
She works here too, how is that any different?
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
You know, I don���t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog���s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
I give thanks, mon.
Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
Um, cheeseburger.
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
It-- it's warm.
Is it criminal?
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
Well, hello.
Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.'
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
This is what���s under the blanket.
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now��� [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Wow. From janitor to manager?
Fifty-two reams!
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
Cici is Jim's daughter.
Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
That's not different enough.
Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.
Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
I need to talk to you in private.
There are lots of considerations.
Darryl, what do I do?
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
It just was one of those things-
If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you���ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
Yeah, sure. What���s your question?
[claps] Chef from South Park, it's genius!
Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]
So much more than words...
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.
Yep. This is Erin.
Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
So make that error!
No.
I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
I don't think it does that.
[lying on table] Do your worst!
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
What is wrong with you?
Mmm-hmm. Erin?
Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
All right.
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
I would agree with that.
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
D-Bone. There you are.
Me likey!
Yeah.
Whoa, where you going?
I guess this is my life now.
[loudly] Harry and the Henderson's
Dwight has defeated the computer.
Okay.
Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
You're welcome.
I mean... I'm impressed.
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
Hey, bud.
Brava, brava.
Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Yeah?
When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
Say it.
Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.
Midnight what?
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...
We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
The conference room!
No, got canned last week.
You mean a moon bounce.
Do you think that they've ever...
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
We're done Meredith.
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Count to twen - count to twenty.
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
Oh, cool.
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ���no��� not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I���m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
Good one. Okay, you ready?
Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
I don't normally do this, but...
No, I insist.
[through tears] Sam! Sam!
Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
Well, that, what's that one?
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
That seems a little far-fetched.
You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
I did, I felt it.
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?
Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
Eight dollars?
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
[singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna?
I can do a better one.
There is one problem with this plan.
Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.
Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that.
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
Yeah.
All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
Perfect.
I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
[Dwight enters] Dwight.
We will start here at Erinville.
Better a cappella!
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
Four!  Three!  Two!  One!
No.
[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why��� Toby is giving us self defense training.
Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
Who's this guy?
Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
These are incentives.  It���s how we���re gonna double growth. Now, you���re probably all asking yourselves: ���Well, how does this work?���
So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
What?
Umm, on the contrary.
Uh...
I miss her too.
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
I'm acting my heart out here.
Why is the truck empty?
Dang it.
Great! [sits down]
What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
Thank you. Not gonna need it.
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Ugh.
Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
Class act. Boy scout.
Oooh.
The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
Mmm. [takes one and eats it]
This is awesome!
Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!
: Yes. And yes. [chuckles]
Bring it on guys.
Okay.
And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
I���ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
Oh.
Where did you get this?!
There you go. Thank you.
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight]
Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
I am going in there! Don���t���
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.
Yeah, I know. Neiche!
Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...
What?
Shut up, Broccoli.
So how do you want, how should I do it?
Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
One. Two. Three. Shot!
Thinking--
Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Night.
Ha. The other guys can go die.
Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn���t.  [to Robert] I���m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They���re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
I cannot believe you're still up!
What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
Get back to normalcy.
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
He sure did.
Awkward.
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
Andrew Bernard.
Such as?
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Erin.
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Like your toothbrush and stuff.
Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
Well now hold on it, it-
It wasn't either of you.
Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
Damn it!
Me too.
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.
Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
[sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
Wet Tuna!
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
You didn���t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now���s your chance! I���m here. You got Qs; I got As.
Didn't see that coming.
You're not making any sense.
I was...
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
You can't. You can't.
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Thank you.
That really works.
How many dates have you been on?
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
This dance competition is not over.
Time!
Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
Hey, Jim.
Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
How could I not have realized?
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
Did she have any last words or?
Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
Can I introduce you around now?
Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
Obviously I'm going to clean up.
And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
Jim.
I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
Yes! I���m sorry I���m being curt, it���s just I���m about to land a top talent agent.
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?
Yeah, I do. I have that.
Okay, guys!
Are you a student here?
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.
Yeah.
Well, well, well, look who it is.
Hey, how are those salads?
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
Nonsense. Get up here.
Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.
I'm Andy.
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.
On it!
Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.
Nope.
I'll check the web.
Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Yeah���um, how is everything?
[sighs]
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Can I think about it?
Is that what that is?
Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
What?!
Yes.
Some people are really popping on screen!
No !  [blows air horn and dances]
Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
Up to you.
Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
What?
No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
Michael... am I gay?
OK great.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
No I'm just sweating.
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
Because we could get some food...
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Well -
Yeah.
Hobos live in trains.
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
It's not that, exactly.
The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
Yeah! Yeah.
Are they on their way over?
No, I-
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
Fine. I will give you one minute.
Naked.
Okay, it sounds risky.
Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
What?
Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.
Nnnnya.
Ugh, oh god!
A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
[outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
Hmm?
No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
[fanfare]
[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.
Hey!
It's junk!
OooOK.
This is Andy Bernard!
Guys..
I'm so jealous right now.
Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
[on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
Why should I believe that?
But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Charge!
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
Hey!
I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.
Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!
Oh, cool.
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
Yeah and we���re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you���d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
Hey, any fun weekend plans?
Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
8pm sharp.
Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
Okay, sorry.
Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
Time's up!
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
Whoa!  What's the situation?
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
Phyllis!
Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
OH MY GOD!
Thank you.
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
You?
Yes, it's Eddie.
[baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.
[interrupting contestant singing ���Beautiful��� by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You���re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You���re like, my three favorite people ever.
Saboteur!
If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
Shane. Great game man!
I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It���s Clark and, um���
That's as hard as I can hint.
Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
That is not okay dude.
G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
We could write a strong-worded letter.
She���s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
What do you mean, take my job?
Was the top salesman...
It's the new guy. [looks at Jim]
Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
Tonight.
[makes frustrated noises]
Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
No.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
Pretty Woman.
OK?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Why? Is it employee���s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
