Look up here!
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
Mm.
[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
Let's just jump in the air!
[laughing] I like tea!
At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
Yes bosses.
Oh, and I care why?
Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound]
Officer.
You're welcome.
I said are you ready TO PARTY!
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
Now?
Yeah, if I had my own--
Who's this guy?
What's up?
Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
Rut ti doh doo doh
Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
No.
Who knows?
What? Based on what?
Stupid dog.
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.
Guess what? Not happening at work.
That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
We kinda nailed it.
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
Dave Matthews.
Sha-bow.
Ooh, she's counting again.
Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
[to Dwight] Where you going?
It's the world's only international sport! [sits down]
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Yeah, but here���s the thing. I can���t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I���ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Well, but it-
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
It's over.
Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
Yeah...
Such as?
Whoa.
I���ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]
Yes!
Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
How do you not have a toothbrush?
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
We'll use code names.
Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
If-
Thank you. That feels good.
It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.
Hey Michael...
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
I'm so jealous right now.
It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
Well, you got it this year too.
That was awful.  Robert I apologize.
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
Through the use of force.
Neither am I, it���s already done.  Hah, I���m just kidding, it���s going to take some time.
No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
The bookstore?
Hey Kevin.
I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se��or Loadenstein.
[weak] Hi Tuna.
I���m going in there.
That's as hard as I can hint.
Fine.
Uh...
There you go. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
No.
What's bad?
[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
Hey.
Whose your favorite iron chef?
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
What if you���re being attacked by a ��� smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
No.
Me too. Hold my place in line.
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Haha, what?
Baseball! Go talk to him.
So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Correction.  It was my idea.
Oh! Ah, Megan.
Carla Fern is not just an actor���s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
What is it, Big Haircut?
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
Come on, just do it.
When I was a salesman I could just be like ���Not my job, not my prob. I���m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.��� Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
Five to six hours?
Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
No.
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
No !  [blows air horn and dances]
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
One came up.
Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
Do you believe in me?
Um, what are we talking price wise?
He does your laundry?
Yeah.
Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs]
[in robot voice] What is going on?
By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
That's how it works!
No, that's ridiculous.
Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Yeah, Dwight.
Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
I don't normally do this, but...
No. It's over between you two.
...my girlfriend's back!
Maybe you're in the ceiling!
Gosh, I hope so.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Yeah, fine.
If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you���ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
[Dwight enters] Dwight.
Oh my God!
Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
Really?
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
I don���t know where it came from.
Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be���[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ���Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes��� by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith���African American���Mambazo.
My first order of business: accept.
Sure, I um..I didn't know.
Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
Yeah.
I���ll explore exploring it.
Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
Really?
What does this say?
Then I'll get something too.
That���s my signature song.
Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]
For happy hour?
[sighs]
May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I���m gonna thank people.
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Dwight we got five strikes.
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
No.
Who is it?
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes���
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
[Angela kisses him] Hey-oh!
Banana cream is the first to go.  We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don���t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I���m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
I can't tell if he's mocking me.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Christmas miracles do happen.
Yikes!
Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Oh.
This is what I was trying to tell you.
I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
No way, lady.
I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
Take care Julia.
I'm acting my heart out here.
Hi.
I give thanks, mon.
Alright.
T-bag bone���
Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
Hundred and twenty points.
I can't hear you through the glass
Well, I think down���s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.
Yeah.
I can make myself cry.
I don't have any ideas though.
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
Dwight?
I guess this is my life now.
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
I promise you that I will.
It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
Okay.
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ���er rip. What do you hate about this place?
It's on!
Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
Sure.
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
Yeah.
You said... [makes gibberish noises]
Maybe we have a plan for you?
Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.
Don't worry. You're not...
I have to pick one of those?
No. No, no.
I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
That���s a crazy amount of points.
Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
Uh, I'll hear the other one.
He���ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
Closet full of mes-
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.
[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
They didn���t know about the snowman story, and when I told ���em, they were not impressed.
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat���am i right?
Well-
Phone's ringing.
Darryl, what do I do?
[pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]
Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
I'm sorry, I meant later.
Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
Oh...
My bare hands.
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
No, I'm just testing if he can hear.
[gets up] I'll do it.
No drama. Ok.
You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
Well, that, what's that one?
Thank you.
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
Guys! Guys! Guys!
It's, I mean.
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
Well played.
OH MY GOD!
Yes.
No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.
No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
That's so beautiful.
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.
No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
No, this is horrifying.
Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
[relieved] Yes!
No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
Mmm, I doubt that very much.
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
Really?
[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?
It has my face on it.
I'm in it to win.
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
Yeah.
Have you lost weight?
No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.
How could I not see it?  You're so right.
Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.
These cookies are fine.
Oh.
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
No, it���s me, Andy!
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
Awesome.
Tonight.
Feel ya, dawg.
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]
Yeah!  I mean it's a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
Yeah.
Right on.
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
Yes, I do.
Okay, so I-
Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.
Great. And Kevin.
[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.
In this climate?
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
Was the top salesman...
Yes!  I'm in.
What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
Oh, cool.
Oooooo, saucy.
Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]
And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
What's up? I got your e-mail.
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
So like, missionary...
Umm, on the contrary.
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
My ass is only so big, I mean I can���t do this everyday.
Seriously, Angela?
Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here?
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
You guys...
Well, ah, ah...
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
I need to talk to you in private.
No! No! No!
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
-ket
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
This is combo number seven.
[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
You do?
It was before, my tech- my technical training.
[standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.
Yes I will.
Oh, come on!
You're being a Thomas Oregon!
Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Hey, boss.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
Aah! This ones hot too!
Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Great group! Pizza party!
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
Yeah?
So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
This is awesome!
Are you playing for the other team?!
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
Sixty bucks a session.
You don't have a toothbrush?
That's really nice, thank you.
God, Toby, don���t���stop blocking my hand.
Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
Already? This, this guy is persistent!
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
���ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
Hey, Danny.
It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.
If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
Then... what are you saying?
I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
I know that it���s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that���s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
Okay, TMI.
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
A minute would be cool.
Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.
Okay.
[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
[shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
[song ends] Toby, how did we do?
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
I insist.
B-9.
Dwight...
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
Ahhh... Is that the last of it?
Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
Mushroom caps.
Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
Yes.
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Whoa! Mind blown. It���s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
Books! Excellent, Jim.
You wanted to see me?
Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.
Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
I can do a better one.
[drumroll with hands] I��� it���s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice���s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ���I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.��� Smart, right?
It���s only 6:00. Come on, everybody���s going.
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
Are you blind?!
I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
Oh. Hmm.
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
which I will not be a part of-
Yeah.
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man���s signature solo is his for life, okay? That���s group policy and you know it.
I changed my mind. [gives Nelly papers]
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
So much more than words...
Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.'
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ���.Confession: I don���t know what I���m doing.
Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
--sorry, you go.
Ha, that's why I wore this shirt.
Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
What are you guys talking about?
Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
OF course not.  There���s no magic button.  You have to summon that.
[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
Duh. I know. That would be insane.
No.
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
Whoa! What is crackin?
Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
Of course. I own my toothbrush.
Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I���m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
And?
Not cool.
And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Yes!
What did you say?
No.
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
Why can't I be in the club?
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Kevin has that lovability.
Hey, Kev.
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
What?
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
No.  No that was real.
Oh.
I am calm.
Oh, really? From what, two to four?
[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling]
No where near the big rock.
Good one. Okay, you ready?
This is gonna look so awesome!
Mmmhmm. [leaves]
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Move it!
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That���s final.
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Ha. The other guys can go die.
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
Pam! Come on!
Thanks.
You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
Why would people say that?
Did Donna tell you that?
What?!
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
Got it. Then I will call you.
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
Isn't that your money?
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
What?
Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
A little warm.
No.
Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.
Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Just make him stop the freaking bus!
I heard it from Erin.
Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
Like a month ago.
[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!
Hey-o!
Which one did you see?
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Uh, that's not what was-
On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
[to Clark] So this is a single.
You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
No. I don't.
[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
Will end completely!
No! [runs off]
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.
He's alive.  So you're welcome.
[hugs Darryl] I���m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I���m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog���had to pull rank.
Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
That's not different enough.
What?
You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it���s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
Okay! Hope you all learned something!
Oh boy. [follows Oscar back to coach]
Well I have the, the blue book value...
Super romantic.
Yes!  Can anyone do those?
She works here too, how is that any different?
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
Uh, did you need something?
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
I don't care, so it doesn't matter.
Hmm. Very true.
Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
Then the basil will be fine.
Yeah? You like it?
Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
It really looks great.  You did a great job.
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
In a minute. In a minute.
Eli Edison.
Yeah.
She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you���re amazing, okay? You���re obviously gonna be on the show, so it���s someone else���s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I���m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
[fist pound each other] Totally.
That is just obnoxious.
I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
: Yes. And yes. [chuckles]
It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
NO!  I want names!
Congratulations to you.
[nodding towards Michael] The Huntsman.
���..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
Death of a salesman.
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.
This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
At least until Stanley calms down.
Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
[sings] What is love?
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Ho hah!....oh, shoot.
I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles]
Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo���hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing��� no traditions!
No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
What���s this?
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
Hey, fellas!  And... lady.
Yes! Thank you! Such as?
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Is this Robert���s attempt to embarrass me?
Who else?
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
Morning, everyone.
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Not at all.
Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
I swear...
With fury...
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
Good-bye, Lackawana County.
Yeah.
What do you mean again?
I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
...Erin...
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
What do you think?
That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
This guy looks like a real deviant.
We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
Hello.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
Mmhmmm.
Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.
That is a penguin. You like it?
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
Close it.
She's taking us back to first base.
You up for a chest bump?
I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.
Darryl is a jerk.
Actor?
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car]
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
Erin go braugh!
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
Yeah, how do you play?
[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
What do you mean?
Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
Class act. Boy scout.
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
How long has it been going on?
Nice.
No, no, no, no, no.
[British accent] No.
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!
Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
And you're fired...
Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.
Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
What do you mean, take my job?
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
Yes!
Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he���s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he���s hard to love, but did you know that he���s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.
Then forget I just told you that.
I know, right?
[to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
You got it.
Hey!
[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
It wasn't either of you.
I���m sorry ��� I���m with a very important client. It���ll have to wait.
Okay, all right, all right, all right.
Why would that make me a pervert, I -
Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
You guys, they're making out.
I'm saying no.
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Thank you.
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
Nope.
Andy, or Andrew.
Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering]
Thank you.
TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
All right.
I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
Why? Is it employee���s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
Wait. Seriously?
What?
Love you too.
What?
Tuna!
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
Ow.
Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
You know Darryl?
[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
You have your team.
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!
Right. Do you see a clue or...
Yeah.
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]
Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
Well that's not--
Ooh. It's coming down out there.
Yes!
It's so good to meet you!
They don't know how.
What?
The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day.
Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
Ah... [stammers]
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
I'm willing to pay you.
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
Very cool.
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
Count me in!
Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Well, so what?  Your body's a ten.
Oh, its on.
Of Flatt & Scruggs!
Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
[points to self] This is the Nard-Dog.
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Hobos live in trains.
Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why��� Toby is giving us self defense training.
I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
D-Bone. There you are.
[turns over card] King of hearts.
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Yes, a madhouse.
Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don���t���it just��� I owe it to myself and my future fans.
That's not what I had in mind.
Say what?
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
[silently mouths] Wow!
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.
Dwight, anything?
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
Or both?
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
...And, Jim.
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
Count to twen - count to twenty.
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don���t know!.....I don���t know.
Have we heard of it?
Where's the concierge?
Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
Down the sides..
Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Are you kidding?
Stock market.
I said no hits!
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
No, this is my time! You don���t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ���action.���
Guys?
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
Your wish is my command.
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
Well, okay then.
What���s the story?
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Hey-o! [applauding and cheering]
We had to leave because of creative differences.
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.
No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
What happened in there?
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.
Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
This branch, I'm the regional manager.
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
What?
I love to dance-
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael]
You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
Ok.
Uh...
Did you see who did it?
[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Cindy, Cindy.
Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
This conversation is over.
It���s just business.
Erin.
This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
We called Angela?
Right?
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
You're not?
...your help. I love her.
Dang it.
I have some good ideas...
Thank you.
Ooh, gosh!
[singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
[through tears] Sam! Sam!
Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
Charge!
Can you get the phone?
I forgot, a��� a pan, uh ���
When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.
Um, cheeseburger.
[Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!
What's the occasion?
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.
Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
Good.  Drew.
Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
I know, right?
Here...
You are murdering the Nard-dog!
Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
Come on!
I have needs.
Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
You're gonna lose all of our money.
She's like, probably a tutor.
Oh, cool.
Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute 'break a legs' or 'I still love you' type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
Give me something!
The cost of doing business.
I think you're going to like it.
Yeah.
I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]
Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
They had, uh��� weapons.
I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side���s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
It was like amateur hour.
Rut tit doh doh...
I don't care either way, so....shut up.
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
Pause after 'news'.
Yeah.
I guess it's starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
I didn't see that movie.
Nifty!
[makes frustrated noises]
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
Hey.
Are you sure?
Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
You know what? Go. Have fun.
Did you mean a real date?
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Take. That down.
Jackpot.
As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
Goat���
I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn���t help.
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
That���s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete���s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
Yes!
Fart���.. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg���s asleep.
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
Fascinating.
Come on pam!
Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I���m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Light side.
No, we were really making out in the woods.
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
Oh.
Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
Atta boy Clark!
Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
What happened to old salty?
Wha-
Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
Yes! The dude is an enigma.
You're welcome.
Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
Wait, what?
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.
Tom Brokaw!
Dude, that is my face!
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.
Will do, boss-man.
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
[falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.
Why would that be weird?
No kidding?
Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That���s something you can���t take back.
Yeah. All right!
I had no idea.
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
What would you say?
[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
Yeah?
Get excited!
Bump! I bumped it!
Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
[inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour!
Dijonnaise.
Awesome. [to Pete] Plop!
Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
Consider it nailed.
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
Maybe like a year ago...
Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
Woo!
Wha, it's-
Seriously?
Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?
And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Well, that went pretty well.
Yeah.
Good morning.
No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.
Beer me!
Let me think about it--
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don���t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''
Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
Duuudes, stop.
I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
And your affiliation with Cornell -
[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
Surprise! [laughs]  It's from everybody.  $15 value.
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
Fine. But I could have.
So bad!
No.
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Who are your role models?
Let's go to the conference room.
This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
You said your upper back itched.
[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
[lying on table] Do your worst!
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
No. Because they all left.
Mmm-hmm. Erin?
My maid died.
See what I mean?
Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
Thanks, Oscar.
Uh...
Thank you.
I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
We won't let you down.
That's a good one.
Hey, Erin.
Yeah.
Might've done. And how��� do you figure?
Divorced?
Is everyone licensed?
Nnnnya.
Very very smart.
Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
I'm still the boss!
It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
This has been a really tough time.
[swings] Dammit!
[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
We have to clean this up now!
Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
I don't even know what that card said.
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Let us know if you need anything.
No, no, no. I���m wearing makeup.
It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
I should make you my vichyssoise.
Jim! How 'bout you?
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
What? No, why?
Alright.
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
��� yeah���
By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Ok, fine.
Surprise! Your new crew.
People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that���s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
Baseball!
[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?
Hey, boss man.
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.
Yeah, come on in. I���m just on hold with another talent agency. It���s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there���s more. 251. 252. I can���t even keep up!
Let's do it.
Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
[in character] Hey there young lady.
[scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.
Alright! Here we go.
Absolutely.
I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.
Oh no.
Hi.
What happened? What can I do to help?
It's like a ten minute walk.
What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It���s like a festival of poo.
Guys..
Hello Kitty's for girls.
Ah... busted. Yes
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
Hey, what���s goin��� on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young���uns?
Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
Do you think that they've ever...
Yeah, some of that existed before.
Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
And one for you.
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
What's up, man?
Should I change?
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor]
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
Done.
I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
WHAT??
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
Everyone! Changed my mind again.
Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar���s friend walks up] Not anything.
Go, go, go, go!
Hi.
Right?
Dr--- You can call me Drew.
Closing time.
Just don���t do the song anymore.
[on phone] Hello.
I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
I don't want to talk about work right now.
Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
What?
What!
Hey, Mrs. California.
Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
[on the computer] You���re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
Took ���em one day.
You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out ���you suck my nutz��� from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
I got you health insurance.
Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.
Some people are really popping on screen!
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
Are you taking your med-meds?
All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby���s thighs]
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
[going for it] Alright.
Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
Hey, Jim.
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
Hi.
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!
Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
Yo.
Well -
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause]
Bye guys.
Excuse me.
Are they from you?
You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
It is not just coffee.
Are you ready?
Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
[speechless]
Oh thanks.
Oh! There we go! Pam?
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
I am the captain.
[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]
Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
Yo. Dudeces.
The temp at night?
[over phone] I am so horny.
I don���t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
Oh, he's out there.
A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Oh God. Come on!
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs]
That's not why I came over.  I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi.
So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]
No, got canned last week.
Yes.
Whoa, fire!
So we're just, like, jamming as friends?
And as such, I come to you...
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
I want you to print that out for me.
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
One. Two. Three. Shot!
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
Baby, don't hurt me.
Oh-oh, come on!
Huh!
I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
[softly] What a coincidence.
Right, it feels strange.
I don't do drugs!
We're losing cloud cover.
Roller derby practice!
She probably a t--
Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Its��� I mean come on.
You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
That was fun last night.
What?
Is it true?
What are you doing here?
[at dump] It's freezing out here.
Never cry wolf.
Why did you do that?!
Tuna dog!
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation���s Lisa Loeb.
Ok.  Erin I think you know I���ve been dating someone.
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
Yeah, absolutely!
Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug.
Whoa, where you going?
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.
Sorry?
Anything.
Oh, my gosh.
That's not how that goes.
Did he tell you how I got the name?
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
Shut up, Broccoli.
Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
Ok. [signs paper] thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?
Maybe. Only maybe.
[waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks!
...That was weird.
No.
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
Express love, magical.
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
No, best thing that ever happened to me.
[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
That...
[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
WHAT?
So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?
Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!
Eight dollars?
Yeah, yeah, it's great...
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
Nice!
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
Noishe.'
Twenty seconds to go time.
Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
I know, right?
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
What?
What are you gonna do with all this time?
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
Good, good. What else?
What���s the mouse���s name?
No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'
[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.
Parkour!
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
Feel it against your cheek.
Yeah. It's pretty close.
That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
Not this time.
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
What?
You're welcome.
Oh, I see.
Ohh...
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
Hi guys.
Ah... sweet!
Right-o.
Up high.
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
Erin!
Why not, dawg?
Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
Yeah?
Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!
I wasn't telling you.
Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
Can I introduce you around now?
No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
Angela?
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Time's up!
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
Aw, that���s cute.
Me likey!
And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
Sorry.
Yeah, I killed.
Yeah, even cooler.
You guys...
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
Oooohhh.
Hey.
Right. Okay.
It is? I'm sorry.
Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
Yes!
Hey.
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
What's that, Stanley?
It's got pheromones in it.
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
Where are you going?
I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]
[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they���ve ever been to me. What I wouldn���t give for one of Phyllis��� classic room clearing farts right now.
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look]
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
What are you still doing not at your desk?
No. What?
Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
I don't think so.
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
Great.
They already have a contract? [Reading] ���Mutually agree to-��� Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
Hey!
Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
Where did you get this?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Thank you!
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael���s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I���m so not prepared.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
Okay. Robert���s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
No!
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
She's babysitting?
A baby what? A human?!
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Oh D!
Better a cappella!
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
Oh, yeah!
Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]
No that's... not how it works.
Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
I don't know how you got there.
Please!
Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.
Love the belt.
Yeah, OK.
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
No, it's in New Mexico.
Excuse me.
Mmmhmmm...
All good, Santa.
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn���t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ���Where were you when the girls came?���
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
I really 'Schruted' it.
Aaah! [everyone clapping] So good!
This is your���you brought this on.
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
How does he feel about it?
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
[confused] Yeah.
Yeah!
Do you know anything about physics?
One. Two. Three. Shot!
Now check the style!
Mmm. [takes one and eats it]
I don't care.
Hey-o!
Michael
You can't. You can't.
Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.
OK great.
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food.
Yeah���um, how is everything?
This is your big day. Come on.
Uhh, beg your pardon?
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz.
You have his email?
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
No, pause longer.
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
The male is a funny species. We don���t just tell each other how we feel, that���s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ���Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don���t want you to leave.��� You say something like, ���Hey, Andy, you���re making the worst mistake of your life. You���re not talented.��� Well��� right back at you, Darryl.
Dwight why don���t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
OK.
What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!
Yeah, it is actually.
Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.
No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That���s what I call the sun now.
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
Thank you.
Is it fresh? [winks]
Yeah!
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
Of course!
[sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna?
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
He drives an SUV!
OK!
I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
That's completely backwards.
Thanks for coming in guys.
Yeah.
Yeah, ok.
Football cream. Grr!
What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Boo-yea! [office laughs]
Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
No.
Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
That's awesome.
What?
I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
I do.
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
You guys ready to party?
Monsieur.
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
[softly] Take that, kid.
Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
I can���t.
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
There was a fire in the warehouse?
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Jim?
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
Thanks T-Dog.
Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
What is all that?
Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Okay, thanks.
[stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.
Don���t touch me.
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
The conference room!
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
Let���s ink���my stink! [crowd cheers]
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
I���ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm���.
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
From total loss to total boss, I mean-
[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...
I wish you well on your quest.
[deep voice] Listen, I don���t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I���ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
You���re exactly right and you get a point.
There he is!
Website check please.
Cool!
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
And it was open. And people saw this. And they���re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
Baby, don't hurt me!
I will fight you.
It���s a photocopy from your notebook.
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
Okey dokey. [knocks on door]
How is that relevant to anything?
Seriously?
Thank you.
All right.
Hello.
No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They���re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
Stop saying my name.
Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture���
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
You bet.
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
And those sand grains are tumbling..
I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
Yeah and we���re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you���d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
Thornwood Wholesalers.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
Not necessary.
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
You didn���t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now���s your chance! I���m here. You got Qs; I got As.
Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
Wet Tuna!
Oh, God.
It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
It was hilarious.
What??
This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
Ehh.
Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
Okay, sorry.
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
Okay.
We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
It's literally like-
Well I'll do you one better.
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
I don't know. [chuckles]
Oh! God! [smacks roaches]
[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?
Let me think about it--
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
Yeah.
A-team.
No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
No.
Anything.  You can ask me anything.
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
8pm sharp.
That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]
This is Andy Bernard!
[Group continues chanting ���Fail!���]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants]
Here���s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam���
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Stanley, you're suppose to close.
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It���s going to be terrible.
Isn't that part of the fun?
But off the record, I'm kinda confused.
Yeah?
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
Yes! I���m sorry I���m being curt, it���s just I���m about to land a top talent agent.
...Ryan...
Yeah, sell.
Yes.
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
I���m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Oh, God!
Yeah?
Even the fact that I'm gay?
His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
That is what I'm showing you.
Jim.
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
[sings] Time to have a little kiss!
How could I not have realized?
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
That brilliant little bitch.
Woo!
Here for what?
Thank you.
[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
Yep.
Are they on their way over?
My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
Yes.
Hmm.
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
I mean... I'm impressed.
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
Time!
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
My name is Andy!
Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
What?
That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
These are delicious.
No.
I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
Make a donation.
You know what--- I don't---
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
I didn't tell you.
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
My nanny used to wear that.
Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
[laughing nervously] Yes.
And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call���Dwight���
I am gay, and I prefer men.
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
What are you...
Kevin, I appreciate what you���re trying to do.
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
Yeah.
What?
Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
I, I thought that you would like it.
Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
You didn���t let me finish. That���s not fair.
Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.
And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
You're such a liar.
Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Mm-hmm.
What about a cat eating man food?
I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you.
I knew it!
Thought about it, I'm in.
Well that's Dallas.
I know, I know that you're proud of me.
Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
There are lots of considerations.
Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
Mm.
No what?
[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
That seems a little far-fetched.
You wanna go?
..The camera don't lie!
Steven Sondheim.
Stop the bus!
Yeah. We are thrilled.
Hi!
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
Good!
Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
I thought you were in rehab.
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
This is kinda time sensitive.
Ugh, oh god!
Oh, just backing up and turning around.
No.
[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Gentleman. [walks away]
You guys came.  Where���s everyone else?
Well, I...
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
No, that���s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about���
Yeah, I do. I have that.
I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
[to Susan] Cameras...
Hey, how are you?
Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I���ll hold. I���m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Try and keep me from coming!
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Put the game on hold everyone.
This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
You're a hoarder. My god!
Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
[looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]
[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.
Heyyy��� let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
No way!
I'm Andy.
Oscar
All right, all right, all right.
C���mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
Phyllis!
Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
Oh, I took out my lifts.
It doesn���t include headshots.
Awwhh, wow.
Kay.
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
These are incentives.  It���s how we���re gonna double growth. Now, you���re probably all asking yourselves: ���Well, how does this work?���
Where are we in the process?
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
Let's not go crazy.
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
You were?
Golf.
Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
Are you sure this is the right way?
What do you think?
I didn't even say what it is.
Re-suture.  Sutures, yes.
Um, nerthing?
Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
None of your business.
Tuna... You're completely sane.
What do you think of Angela?
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area]
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
What?
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
No.
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
Wahhh...
Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
Can I think about it?
[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in]
Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
Noishe!
[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion���
Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women���s soccer, no?
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!
David Walrus, in his native habitat.
Just do it.
Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
There���s a mole?
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.
Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
No no no no.
Yeah Jim, get it out there.
This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
Whoa!
That's a lie.
Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
Gahhh. That's five strikes.
Rut ti doh doh...
Okay.
Night.
Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
What can't go on?
Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
Drew.  I'm Drew now.
[claps] Chef from South Park, it's genius!
[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.
We're just friends, okay?
Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
Done and done-er.
Safe travels.
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Awesome.
Yeah, so, I���ll see you on the red carpet. See, that���s how it works.
Damn it!
Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk]
Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away]
You have to.
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.
Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
Can I talk to you a minute?
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
We couldn���t crack it.
We will be team U.S.A.
I'll go with you Stanley.
What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
Mmhmmm.
[cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
For two hours? Really?
[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
Oh! Seven new comments. ���The guy at 0:19 is hawt!��� [typing] ���Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!���[reading] ���He's not hawt, he's gay.��� [typing] ���Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.��� [reading] ���He is hawt!��� See, thank you, that's more like it. ���He is butt.��� God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
[looking at Angela's costume] Approved!
Andy. What���s yours?
Clean the toilets.
Hey... David Wallace!
OK, fine, yeah. that���s one guy���s opinion!
Thank you. Yeah,
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now��� [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
Oh, there's an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-
I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
Are you saying-
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
Is that what that is?
You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what���s up? Back in the small pond?
Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
OooOK.
Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
Yeah!
... not what I meant.
Alright.
I'll call you back.
Yeah, I know. Neiche!
Stop doing that!
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
[signing his name] Andrew��� Baines��� Bernard.
Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Oh my god.
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Well...
How about a little bit of this.
Saying I love... Saying I love you...
Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
250
Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
Okay.
I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
A madhouse.
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Um.
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
What?
Hey! Pam!
EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!
Yeah, yeah.
This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
No.
Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
Of course there are!
What?
Let me get a picture of you guys.
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it���s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let���s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
You humiliated me in front of every body!
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Thank you. [steps into conference room]
Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who���s next? Darryl?
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing]
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Hey! Tuna! He's back.
All right!
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
Ah, OK.
Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
Sure? Okay.
Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
I will try.
Get back to normalcy.
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
Jamie!
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Ay-o!
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
Well girls tell each other things right?
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
Hey! High-five!
Do you love him?
[throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
Yes.
Where?
Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
Cool, thanks.
Pizza rolls.
It sure seems like he is lying.
What���s up, guys? Just thought we���d have a little rap session, talk about business���see how things are going? Ahem���
Women friends?
Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
What?
Yep. This is Erin.
[dances] Whoo! Yeah!
Megan Fox! Come on!
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
What if you���re being attacked by a 4���11��� man who is penisless?
You got it.
Hmm... mm, what's that smell?
Ah, come on!
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Why don���t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Hey!
Specific shout-out..
Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
No way!?
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ���You can't be a skipper until you're a man.��� You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
Yeah.
I'll use my hands on it.
[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
That sounds weird.
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...
Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
Nonsense. Get up here.
No I'm just sweating.
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
Excuse me?
Duh.
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
How does that work?
There���s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
Everyone.
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Let's go, let's go.
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine]
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.
Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
Ooh, that sounds great.
You didn't have to do that.
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven't had a very hard life.
Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together. [Andy plays video]
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
What's going on?
Are you insane? It���s the Cornell fight song.
Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
I'm doing this for you Meredith!
[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
Are you volunteering?
Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
Nope! [stands up and leaves]
Michael... am I gay?
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
So, it's a date.
That's clever, Debutante.
[raised eyebrows] Okay.
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
We promised we���d never say goodbye.
Are you a student here?
Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
What is wrong with her?
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
Who else knows about it?
That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Hello.
Yeah, yeah.
Welcome.
There���s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales���
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
Yeah.
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
Trying to get a head count.
That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don't let me die here.
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
Well, technically FOR Andy.
After you.
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
How many dates have you been on?
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
Really?
Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That���s what you did with this trip.
[making pencil imprint] Dammit.
No, I-
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
Rehash���
Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?
Hi gam-gam.
Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]
Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
Didn't see that coming.
Thank you. [leaves]
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
That was not a fail.
Can you do it?
Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
And you didn't invite any of us?
For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
You just use whichever one is sitting there?
I don't care, that's how much I swear!
[buzzer noise] We were looking for 'kitten.'
I'm...  I'm asking you out.
Nice to meet you.
Yes!
I'm telling you to back down.
Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
[chuckles] Addition by subtraction.
No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
Surprise!
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
17 B.C.
Yes?
Wow, that's wonderful!
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
Brava, brava.
I wasn't acc-, accusing...
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
You think I can do better?
Yeah, right?
Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
[applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
We're one in a million.
Thanks, Angela. You too.
Stanley.
Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
But you're calling me a liar.
Oh. Hmm.
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Hm?
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Hey!
No, I'm good.
Did you check the vending machine?
My Cornell a capella group.
I would like that.
Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
I���m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it���s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
You sure it's saber?
And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
Well, hello.
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Oooh.
Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I���
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
Alright, I'll tell Dwight.
Great!
Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
I���m not going to take it. And then he���s going to be like ���whoa this is a really important meeting���.
Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
Hmm.
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus' Party in the USA]
Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
That you're sleeping with Dwight.
Dwight?
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
All right, yes! It's a deal.
It-- it's warm.
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
This is what���s under the blanket.
Maybe we could switch instruments.
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!
What?!
He sure did.
Whoa.
All right. Formative years. [She laughs]
I know, right?
Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
You don���t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
I cannot believe you're still up!
Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
[opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.  We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.  Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.  Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider]  Yeees!  [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted.
You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
Did you check your... butt?
I mean, it's distant, but...
I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol��� family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
Whoo.
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I���m thinking of. Can you clarify that?
I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
[with a sigh] Okay.
All in! Whoo!
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
You'll thank me when they spank thee.
Are you serious?
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Ow! Get off! Get off!
Who was Cornell's eighth president?
Val, I need the space.
0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
That's...
No, I do not.
Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
Okay, it sounds risky.
Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
Cool.
We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]
Dwight!
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
You got a minute?
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
Thank you.
They sure do.
Lot going on guys. What���s happening?
Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
Alright fine.  You know what ��� I guess this place just hasn���t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I���m still going.  And I���m not going to ask anymore.  I���m not even going to look back.  I���m just going to assume that you���re with me.
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
[laughs]
[on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
Well-
Why does Erin like Gabe?
Yeah.
[looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
Yeah, it was. That���s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.
Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Is it true?
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
Is it criminal?
Midnight what?
Thank you.
It just was one of those things-
Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
Yeeeeah.
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
Hey, yes.
...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
Why is the truck empty?
Hmm?
Twenty points.
[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Dwight has defeated the computer.
Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down.
I... don't know. Help me.
[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
Have a good meeting!
Alright, I've scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
Who says that?
[outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]
I had no idea.
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
Alright, you got it.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-
I'll check the web.
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
Crystal.
Message received, little soy bean.
Can you go over those options again?
You're asking him to give up all of his power.
Fine. I will give you one minute.
I got mine. They were really good.
[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.
See you later.
I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
Enngh-
Say it.
Dwight's grandfather was a���[is interrupted by Dwight].
Do you know the other state?
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ���move on���. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
Ah, OK.
Why? Why? [looks at Jim]
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
Sh---
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.
Who?
Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,
I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
So.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
Well-
I was...
I didn���t do anything any of you wouldn���t have done.
That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
I have a delicious secret.
My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
What���re you still doing here?
Oh, baloney.
Aww, I mean...
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]
You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
What?
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...
I'm taking it over from here.
And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
We're gonna do it outside.
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
Yeah. Right.
Dwight.
Thank you. [hangs up]
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.
Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
Yes, yes, yes!
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
No way!
[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Really?
Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.
Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!
Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
Okay.
No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it���s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
No games?
Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
Is somebody there?
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.
Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
There what is?
Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
Doesn���t mean you���re the best singer ever. Dick.
How?
Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say 'aye']
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
You're right, that is new.
What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
Make it higher? Okay.
So... here's the thing about infidelity.
Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]
[doing eyewash] AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
You never update it.
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.
All right, who���s next? Nellie?
Whoa. Okay.
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
Angela Bernard.
Where's Dwight?
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
No thanks.
I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
Yeah.
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
That's it!
Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
[eyewashes again] AHH! AHH! AHH!
Sure.
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
They just didn���t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
Right? Rough scene.
Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
I'm her fiance.
Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
Hey. What's up?
Kaaw!
Yes, I do. Phyllis.
I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We���re 100 percent staffed up.
Exactly.
Yeah, sure. What���s your question?
I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
[passes out hats] One for you.
It's John Gotti, you idiot!
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
Wow.
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
Hail to the chief!
Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
And you sold it to Jan too.
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
You mean a moon bounce.
Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I���ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
A delicious moment.
OK what?
What the heck was that?
Close it.
What's up?
Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
Thinking--
My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?
I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
Not helping, tuna.
That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
We're taking a picture.
Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
It's junk!
I believe it means mouth pleaser.
What?
Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
Not my slaves, my ancestors���. Maybe. Probably not.
Yeah. D for Andy.
Woo-hoo.
I think we should.
I accidentally ate some seahorses.
That's insane!
Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.
Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
Not guy friends?
Hey boss. Got a minute?
Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that.
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
Of course.
Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
Awkward.
I���m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
Stop just saying that.
This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Hey, we'll be just fine.
Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
[singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
You know, I don���t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog���s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
Do you guys like apples?
Welcome back Tuna!
You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
That is not okay dude.
[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.
What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'
Class is canceled, everybody out!
Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
Do it.
Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Okay.
Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you���re talking about?
Say what?
...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
No. Not that I see here.
[taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
Don���t care. Tell me later.
I don���t think she���s dead.
Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight]
What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.
I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
Good morning, Pam.
Closing time
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
It doesn't matter.
Mm, well, you used to be.
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
I believe in that.
What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...
Kevin, you open it up.
She's nature's bounty.
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
You're not making any sense.
Nice sweater.
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
Huh?
Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
Hey-o!
Okay, Tuna.
Aw!
Uh, dream. Goin��� with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn���t that right, Jim?
Darryl said, ���Cool, man.��� He called me as cool man.
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
Why? Everybody's heard it.
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
Chicken pot pie.
Andrew Bernard.
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Afterwards at the...
You can't dock my pay-
And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
There is one problem with this plan.
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin��� movie star! [kicks trash can]
You sure?
Why would you say that?
Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good.
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
Oh my god.
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
Mmmm.. suck-ah!
That really works.
It's not that, exactly.
He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
Thank you. Not gonna need it.
[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.
I mean... [Pam giggles]
[coughs word] Idiot!
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
Well... there's no instructions.
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Go away, we're running lines.
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
Sure.
Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
Four!  Three!  Two!  One!
[loudly] Harry and the Henderson's
Eleanor Roosevelt once said ���the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.��� [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she���s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I���m doing the right thing.
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
Yes.
I wanna take you to sex school.
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
Costume vetoed.
Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.
Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
No, I did not.  Was that any good?
Alright everybody, you are doing great!
So you had a bad day...
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
Do the next one.
What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs]
We lost the account.
Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.
Everyone please, just-
Question. Where's Jim?
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
Oh yeah.
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin']
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
Sweet.
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
[drinks hand soap]
Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Wow. From janitor to manager?
[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.
End the mistakes, easy-
Saving the best for first!
Yeah, I know.
Oscar, it's not that hot out.
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
Cici is Jim's daughter.
You would?
What?
[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It���s Clark and, um���
Do you have a specific place in mind?
Yeah, I guess.
No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
Do you know why you never heard of it?
[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]
Hey, have you guys seen her?
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
Congratulations.
[interrupting contestant singing ���Beautiful��� by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You���re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You���re like, my three favorite people ever.
[in falsetto] Please Mr. President-
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
I was too embarrassed! [group laughs]
This is for pleasure.
[on computer screen] Ah, what else? I���ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
Oh, no.
All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
If I am not Boner Champ, I don���t know who I am.
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
Hour forty-five.
Because we could get some food...
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Thank you, David.
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
When what? [clears throat] When what?
Let me know what they say.
I left my cell phone in my car.
I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I���m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I���m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they���re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you���re in the good old days before you���ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
You don���t like the hats?
No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.
Yeah.
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
You all made it, thank you so much.
Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
Dah!  Come on!
And where did you go?
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
I didn't.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Did you maybe tell them that or...?
Well, Carla knows.
That's not you.
Yeah, me, too.
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
I'm punishing them.
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?
Naked.
Did she have any last words or?
Sorry, when did you get married?
She���s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
Okay.
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
Oh D.
Great! [sits down]
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
Yes, it's Eddie.
Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Bring it on guys.
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ���HARD ASS���] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
Are you factoring in the��� whole national ���economy���. declining and all that?
Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]
All righty.
I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.
And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
Whoa!  What's the situation?
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis' iPod]
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
The fire's shooting at us!
No I���m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn���t, I���m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don���t like to throw around the b-word, but I���m going to be a huge bitch to you.
Yeah, what day?  What day?
Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
Yeah, but��� My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Why did we pretend like we work here?
Carla! Carla!
No.
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.
Okay.
Yeah, right?
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
[sighs] Yeah.
AHHHHH!!!!!!!
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
We need you, OK?
Yeah, uh, excuse me.
I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
I found my calling.
Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.
Then I will write it down.
Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?
[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]
[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Oh, oh!
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
Your text said 911.
Well, well, well, look who it is.
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
[with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.
Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
Yes! Yes.
Yeah. Um line 1?
can you believe this guy?
It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
What? Sorry.
Michael, you're up.
Yeah. Name another.
I gotta go talk to her.
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
Great game, coach.
Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell]
I'm pretty good at board games.
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Oh, whew!
then I'll take a table!
So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
[punches button] Speakerphone!
Yeah.
Russell, I���m dressed like George Michael.
So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Yeah! Yeah.
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
[baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Hey, any fun weekend plans?
What?!
Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
Night.
G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
My parents are broke.
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.
Seriously?
Like your toothbrush and stuff.
Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
���.Stanley..
I think he can hear us.
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
Okay!
Come on, get over here.
I'm thinking about it--
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor���.vanilla?
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'
My new girlfriend.
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
Sure.  I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
And you will be hearing from -
Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
Ribbit!
Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.
Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I���m going to refuse to take it.
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
No. It���s a job. Things are going great.
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
We should think about this���does anyone have any better ideas?
Yeah.
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
...and an American Express green card.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
What?!
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
Okay.
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
Nope. I have made up my mind. I���m really sorry.
The one in the green hoodie.
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
What do you got?
And this is where I will record your sales.
A year.
Yeah, it's a kilt.
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
[claps] That was fantastic.
And the Christmas party.
Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
Well I don't see that happening.
You know your soccer, man.
Really?  That doesn't sound right.
So?
I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.
I���m sorry, what?
I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ���Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas��� Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.
Umm... I'm number three.
Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.
Dwight.
Alright, a plan it is.
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Just close it.
Into the mic, sweetie.
I play the banjo.
This man has a gift!
Fine!
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
As in...
How romantic is this?
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
Angela!
Yes I can.
Uh, this has got to stop.
Yeah.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert���man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how���s the sales doubling ���project going?
So make that error!
No... I didn't steal your joke.
Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
And I'm a director.
Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
That is so mom.
Ah! That���s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
Yeah.
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
I���m delivering it from the fridge. It���s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.
She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
Are you okay?
Those are fully staffed as well.
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
It was like a security blan-
Hey, bud.
I am so great!
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
Yeah.
No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
Seems like...
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
Get out of my way, Jim!
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
Did the email go out or���
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
I wasn���t fired. What are you talking about? I���m fired up, yes. Guys, I���m���I���m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
Nah. I like my plan better.
Well, that...really bums me out.
It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
Yeah.
Your hands.
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.
K
What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
It was?
Yes like a chime or a bell...
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
Are you...
But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Just need a second outside.
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
Later man.
[struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
Right?
Right?
I bought these.
Well it���s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
[Darryl runs in slow motion on video]
Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.
Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.
Seriously?' Are you serious?
Yeah.
Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we���re talking about is���basically the speech equivalent��� to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use���but need need for talk talk.
Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
...So help us out.
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
Up to you.
Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
That's a racing stripe.
I'm glad you asked ��� Connecticut Casual.
The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.
Where is my FREAKING phone?!
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
A little frazzled.
[chuckling] Okay.
Cause that says, that says...
Now this is called slack lining.
Don���t���don���t���
It's like a haunted disco.
You're the only person who's congratulated me.
Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]
Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords!
So how do you want, how should I do it?
Einsteins! Great work.
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
I stole it!
That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
Thanks Dad���Darryl.
Hmm.
Do you like apples?
[singing] You know I can, my man.
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
Because you suck.
I am dying of lovesickness and horny-sickness.
Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
WB!
Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Oscar says ���hi��� all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ���Hi��� ���Hello��� ���Hola��� You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ���hi���?
No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
Cool.
Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
Well it's the thought that counts.
Partay. Room 639.
Yeah. [clapping]
For four more days.
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
Hey Kevin, what are you doing?
Bah���I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
I���m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Big day for you.
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
Where?
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
So pretty today.
What?
Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who?
I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
Pretty Woman.
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Better a cappella.
Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
Okay, guys!
It's not... Whether or not, you...
No. I���m a rogue.
Yeah.
I got it, try, um--[Coughs]
[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Do me! Do me!
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Is that right?
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
[laughs] Totally!
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
Sounds controversial.
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Are we scaring them straight....?
Look, it's not that I don't want-
David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
I do.
Edgy impressions.
Ooh I didn���t mean to offend you, and I hope you���ll forgive me because I am very very��� Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
You know, the marmalade sounds great.
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Are we rotating seats, or?
I just need you to know-
What?
Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
[joking] What do I know?
You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
[to Michael's camera] Hardcore Parkour!
Right-o.
Hey-OH!
Covered it up.
-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'
David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I���d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
What are we gonna do about this?
[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
Then I'll make you.
Hey, how are those salads?
Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.
Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.
Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
Which is insanely painful.
Why don���t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
I'm your wingman.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
They are already off, my good sir.
The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Fire guy [makes flames with his hands]
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
Walk around apple orchards.
Rude. And not helpful.
Hmm?
What?
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
I think I should go the hospital.
Thank you, Erin.
OK. [to Erin] I'll call you later.
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?
[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you?
Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
I know it's like cricket.
Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....
Hang on.
Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.
What are you thinking?
Bro, I do that all the time.
Who is the gal in question?
Of the hourglass..
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
Charge!
That's low, Tuna.
Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
White, because it contains all other colors.
And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Clutch cream run, bro.
You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
Wait, wait.
Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Aw!! Way better a cappella
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
No, that's...
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.
How's it going over here, guys?
You did not, Kenny!
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
Even without an audience you���re still at it.
If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.
[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.
Oh, okay. I don���t want any part of this.
Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
He beat the computer.
Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
[singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe��� you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
I'm gonna lose 'em.
Hmm? Who? Sam?
Hey there. It���s a pleasure.
What are you going to see?
My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
Are you sure?
[Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon'
Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
Obviously I'm going to clean up.
Oh... at least we can kiss now.
[blowing air horn] Yeah!
[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
No I didn���t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it���s weird that she���s not calling.
Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I���m all for it.
Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...
Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Thirty-one.
Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
Why should I believe that?
[coughs sentence] Nice comeback!
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
We're done Meredith.
That's actually 'Master of Ceremonies' Bernard.
Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
You look awesome.
All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]
This is great.
I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
Agh! Son of a bitch!
Can we talk about this in private?
I call foul, sir.
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
Oh!
[removes teeth] Creed's going?!
Okay.
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ���You guys are killing it!��� I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...
Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.
Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Hey-oh!
[knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
I'm sorry, nine days until what?
[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?
We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]
Yeah, its where they make stuff.
Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight]
I mean, it's pretty broken already.
And it���s getting a little more serious.  She���s never come by.
Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ���no��� not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I���m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
It's my ear.
Hey!
Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
Why would anyone frame you for that?
Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
OK, keep in mind, it���s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points���.or best offer.
We could write a strong-worded letter.
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.
What?
I don't know.
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
My whole life is a booger bubble!
Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves��� [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
Pffft.
Mmm.
Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
Oh! [laughter]
And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.
Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
[at same time as Kevin] I did it.
Sure.
I am going in there! Don���t���
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar]
[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.
Australian accent...
[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
Jim?
Gotta get my goin' out on.
Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!
I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
Ok.
Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
It���s now or never.
Fifty-two reams!
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
The answer is yes.
You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
[fanfare]
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
All right. I get it.
What's up, gangstas?
Hey Darryl.
[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ���95. Hey there, um, I���m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here���De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale���uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I���m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
Just, please...
