It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
I���m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
[deep voice] Listen, I don���t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I���ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look]
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
Banana cream is the first to go.  We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
[interrupting contestant singing ���Beautiful��� by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You���re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You���re like, my three favorite people ever.
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
[on computer screen] Ah, what else? I���ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
Darryl said, ���Cool, man.��� He called me as cool man.
He���ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
We had to leave because of creative differences.
[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.
Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ���Banjo at 0:19 is aight��� Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
No, we were really making out in the woods.
Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
I know that it���s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that���s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation���s Lisa Loeb.
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
Dude, you struck out.  They're totally stuck up.  Here... drink up.
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn���t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ���Where were you when the girls came?���
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
Well it���s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
I���m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it���s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in]
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
It really looks great.  You did a great job.
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....
Here���s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam���
Fart���.. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg���s asleep.
Swear to God, hope to die. Now let���s get to work!
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
I didn't know you were going to be here.
I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
Are you factoring in the��� whole national ���economy���. declining and all that?
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
[to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
Yeah, but��� My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it���ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
You were saying you chose me���. There was a reason?
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I���m going to refuse to take it.
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
[on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.
Let me get a picture of you guys.
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor���.vanilla?
You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
[Group continues chanting ���Fail!���]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants]
[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
That���s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
You my friend are in a very close second.
That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]
I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I���m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I���m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they���re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you���re in the good old days before you���ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
I guess it's starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
I���m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.
Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
What if you���re being attacked by a 4���11��� man who is penisless?
Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I���m thinking of. Can you clarify that?
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?
Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]
A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.
I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women���s soccer, no?
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ���move on���. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?
Nope. I have made up my mind. I���m really sorry.
[sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
They didn���t know about the snowman story, and when I told ���em, they were not impressed.
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
You never told me you were in high-school!
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
There���s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales���
Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!
I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]
Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
I���m delivering it from the fridge. It���s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?
I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.
Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
Why? Is it employee���s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
Oh! Seven new comments. ���The guy at 0:19 is hawt!��� [typing] ���Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!���[reading] ���He's not hawt, he's gay.��� [typing] ���Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.��� [reading] ���He is hawt!��� See, thank you, that's more like it. ���He is butt.��� God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
C���mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
There���s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
Uh, dream. Goin��� with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn���t that right, Jim?
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause]
We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
Ooh I didn���t mean to offend you, and I hope you���ll forgive me because I am very very��� Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
Well, I think down���s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol��� family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area]
Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why��� Toby is giving us self defense training.
Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
This is what I was trying to tell you.
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
I left my cell phone in my car.
Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]
[at same time as Kevin] I did it.
What happened? What can I do to help?
I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
You humiliated me in front of every body!
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who���s next? Darryl?
Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don���t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!
So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe��� you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?
[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?
Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
So how do you want, how should I do it?
There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say 'aye']
I���m sorry ��� I���m with a very important client. It���ll have to wait.
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
The male is a funny species. We don���t just tell each other how we feel, that���s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ���Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don���t want you to leave.��� You say something like, ���Hey, Andy, you���re making the worst mistake of your life. You���re not talented.��� Well��� right back at you, Darryl.
No, I'm just testing if he can hear.
From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you���re amazing, okay? You���re obviously gonna be on the show, so it���s someone else���s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I���m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
Oh, okay. I don���t want any part of this.
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.
Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]
Here it is, you should draw a picture...
All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
No, I did not.  Was that any good?
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]
Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...
Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you���re talking about?
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ���You guys are killing it!��� I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.
Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
I'm not asking for one, I need it.
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves��� [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]
Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
I don't want to talk about work right now.
���ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
I wasn���t fired. What are you talking about? I���m fired up, yes. Guys, I���m���I���m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
Yeah, come on in. I���m just on hold with another talent agency. It���s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there���s more. 251. 252. I can���t even keep up!
I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar���s friend walks up] Not anything.
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin']
No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
[looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Does anything go on top of the mouse?
It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you.
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
You didn���t let me finish. That���s not fair.
Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?
Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
Why would that make me a pervert, I -
[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
I don���t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
[opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.  We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.  Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.  Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider]  Yeees!  [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted.
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
No I didn���t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it���s weird that she���s not calling.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
What if you���re being attacked by a ��� smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.
Why don���t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call���Dwight���
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
I didn���t do anything any of you wouldn���t have done.
Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
[knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
[on the computer] You���re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I���m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
Neither am I, it���s already done.  Hah, I���m just kidding, it���s going to take some time.
No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they���ve ever been to me. What I wouldn���t give for one of Phyllis��� classic room clearing farts right now.
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]
Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute 'break a legs' or 'I still love you' type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
I need to talk to you in private.
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
What are you gonna do with all this time?
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here?
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.
I don't care, that's how much I swear!
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus' Party in the USA]
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
What are you gonna play mange on faster?
You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it���s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
I���ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
And it���s getting a little more serious.  She���s never come by.
Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
My ass is only so big, I mean I can���t do this everyday.
Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They���re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...
This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles]
Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
[drumroll with hands] I��� it���s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice���s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ���I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.��� Smart, right?
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
No I���m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn���t, I���m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don���t like to throw around the b-word, but I���m going to be a huge bitch to you.
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
You didn���t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now���s your chance! I���m here. You got Qs; I got As.
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]
Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what���s up? Back in the small pond?
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I���m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog���had to pull rank.
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man���s signature solo is his for life, okay? That���s group policy and you know it.
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I���m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
No, this is my time! You don���t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
They already have a contract? [Reading] ���Mutually agree to-��� Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
When I was a salesman I could just be like ���Not my job, not my prob. I���m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.��� Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I���ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert���man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how���s the sales doubling ���project going?
Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car]
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs]
I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn���t help.
Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
[waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks!
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]
Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!
They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture���
All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
Not my slaves, my ancestors���. Maybe. Probably not.
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you���ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion���
You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
OK, keep in mind, it���s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points���.or best offer.
Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?
Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I���
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
We should think about this���does anyone have any better ideas?
I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.
No, best thing that ever happened to me.
Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
���..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
How could I not see it?  You're so right.
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.
Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It���s going to be terrible.
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ���action.���
What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.'
OF course not.  There���s no magic button.  You have to summon that.
She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.
Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
I didn't.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.
No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
[singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don't let me die here.
Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
Sure.  I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.
[singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
Heyyy��� let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.
Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
Dwight why don���t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
I don't even know what that card said.
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.
It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
I���m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can.
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it���s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ���.Confession: I don���t know what I���m doing.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.
We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Carla Fern is not just an actor���s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]
Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There���s a review of the documentary!
[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That���s what I call the sun now.
Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
What���s up, guys? Just thought we���d have a little rap session, talk about business���see how things are going? Ahem���
I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good.
Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
And come and tell me. Doesn���t matter what it is.
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.
No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
She���s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se��or Loadenstein.
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
They just didn���t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food.
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
That���s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete���s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
Did he tell you how I got the name?
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.
[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat���am i right?
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it���s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let���s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]
Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
You all made it, thank you so much.
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
And this is where I will record your sales.
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be���[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ���Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes��� by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith���African American���Mambazo.
To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out ���you suck my nutz��� from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ���Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas��� Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
You just use whichever one is sitting there?
[throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
Ah! That���s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
Yeah, it was. That���s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.
Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now��� [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
That's not why I came over.  I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi.
Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
Bah���I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I���d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
[Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon'
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
No, that���s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about���
Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael���s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I���m so not prepared.
Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
I, I thought that you would like it.
If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
Whoa! Mind blown. It���s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Alright fine.  You know what ��� I guess this place just hasn���t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I���m still going.  And I���m not going to ask anymore.  I���m not even going to look back.  I���m just going to assume that you���re with me.
In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
Are you insane? It���s the Cornell fight song.
I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away]
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we���re talking about is���basically the speech equivalent��� to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use���but need need for talk talk.
I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo���hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing��� no traditions!
Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs]
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down.
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
I���m not going to take it. And then he���s going to be like ���whoa this is a really important meeting���.
Yeah, so, I���ll see you on the red carpet. See, that���s how it works.
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That���s what you did with this trip.
There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand]
Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day.
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don���t know!.....I don���t know.
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
I'm like a quarter of the way through.
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
What are you still doing not at your desk?
The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs]
So Darryl says to me ���fire me���. But what he really means is ���I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.��� So I say ���No, you're not fired.��� But what I really mean is ���I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.���........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.
I���ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I���m all for it.
Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn���t.  [to Robert] I���m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.
I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'
No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.
I���ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm���.
The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
[hugs Darryl] I���m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That���s something you can���t take back.
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ���er rip. What do you hate about this place?
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
It���s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line.  Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.
Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
Doesn���t mean you���re the best singer ever. Dick.
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It���s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That���s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby���s thighs]
Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
And it was open. And people saw this. And they���re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz.
Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
Alright, I've scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
Why don���t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he���s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he���s hard to love, but did you know that he���s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
These are incentives.  It���s how we���re gonna double growth. Now, you���re probably all asking yourselves: ���Well, how does this work?���
She works here too, how is that any different?
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
I know, I know that you're proud of me.
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side���s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
Ok.  Erin I think you know I���ve been dating someone.
They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
Then I want my big blue sweater back.
-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It���s like a festival of poo.
Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
[stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.
The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
[outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]
Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.
No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..
[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling]
Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin��� movie star! [kicks trash can]
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
Okay. Robert���s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords!
Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I���m gonna thank people.
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
I use the word ���guys��� a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.
I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
But I just���it���s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn���t���
What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
That you���re learning a made-up language from HBO���s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don���t���it just��� I owe it to myself and my future fans.
[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you���re Boner Champ.
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
[looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.
After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I���ll hold. I���m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Eleanor Roosevelt once said ���the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.��� [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she���s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I���m doing the right thing.
Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
[applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]
G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
Yes! I���m sorry I���m being curt, it���s just I���m about to land a top talent agent.
Hey, what���s goin��� on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young���uns?
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
No. It���s a job. Things are going great.
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We���re 100 percent staffed up.
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.
I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
Even without an audience you���re still at it.
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]
Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.
[shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.
[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!
That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Yeah!  I mean it's a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
Umpf���that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that���s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven't had a very hard life.
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
Kevin, I appreciate what you���re trying to do.
[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
