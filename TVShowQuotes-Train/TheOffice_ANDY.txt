Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I���m thinking of. Can you clarify that?
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ���Banjo at 0:19 is aight��� Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.
I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Yeah, but��� My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
I want you to print that out for me.
Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
This is what I was trying to tell you.
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
Well it���s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Kevin, I appreciate what you���re trying to do.
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don���t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day.
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.
I left my cell phone in my car.
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
She works here too, how is that any different?
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it���s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let���s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
No, that���s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about���
Fine.  I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
These are incentives.  It���s how we���re gonna double growth. Now, you���re probably all asking yourselves: ���Well, how does this work?���
Umpf���that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ���action.���
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can.
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.
Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
I���m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it���s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
[hugs Darryl] I���m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
Heyyy��� let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine]
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.
What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
So Darryl says to me ���fire me���. But what he really means is ���I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.��� So I say ���No, you're not fired.��� But what I really mean is ���I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.���........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
I know that it���s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that���s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.
We should think about this���does anyone have any better ideas?
Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
I���m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it���ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
You were saying you chose me���. There was a reason?
I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.
Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.
Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?
[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
You know, I don���t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog���s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ���You can't be a skipper until you're a man.��� You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I���m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I���m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they���re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you���re in the good old days before you���ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I���m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat���am i right?
Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...
How could I not see it?  You're so right.
Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There���s a review of the documentary!
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Did he tell you how I got the name?
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
Yeah, come on in. I���m just on hold with another talent agency. It���s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there���s more. 251. 252. I can���t even keep up!
I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
Here���s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam���
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
[drumroll with hands] I��� it���s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice���s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ���I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.��� Smart, right?
That's not why I came over.  I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi.
On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!
What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
That you���re learning a made-up language from HBO���s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin��� movie star! [kicks trash can]
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]
I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
You my friend are in a very close second.
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Yeah!  I mean it's a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves��� [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We���re 100 percent staffed up.
Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I���m going to refuse to take it.
[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It���s going to be terrible.
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion���
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs]
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
I don���t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
I don't want to talk about work right now.
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.
This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
I was telling that... I was telling that.
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se��or Loadenstein.
Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they���ve ever been to me. What I wouldn���t give for one of Phyllis��� classic room clearing farts right now.
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Banana cream is the first to go.  We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who���s next? Darryl?
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
It���s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand]
Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ���Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas��� Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.
You didn���t let me finish. That���s not fair.
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
They didn���t know about the snowman story, and when I told ���em, they were not impressed.
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
Sure.  I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.
Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.
[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...
We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that���s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?
You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
I, I thought that you would like it.
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
I���m sorry ��� I���m with a very important client. It���ll have to wait.
That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It���s like a festival of poo.
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol��� family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women���s soccer, no?
You all made it, thank you so much.
Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
My ass is only so big, I mean I can���t do this everyday.
Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes���
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
Fart���.. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg���s asleep.
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away]
Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
Alright, I've scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?
And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
Yes! I���m sorry I���m being curt, it���s just I���m about to land a top talent agent.
But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That���s something you can���t take back.
I���m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
It's the world's only international sport! [sits down]
I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
You���re exactly right and you get a point.
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!
Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
Why don���t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
They just didn���t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don���t know!.....I don���t know.
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I���d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven't had a very hard life.
Well I have the, the blue book value...
So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
No I didn���t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it���s weird that she���s not calling.
What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you���re Boner Champ.
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]
I don't even know what that card said.
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
Why? Is it employee���s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
which I will not be a part of-
I didn���t do anything any of you wouldn���t have done.
Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.
I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ���HARD ASS���] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we���re talking about is���basically the speech equivalent��� to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use���but need need for talk talk.
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
Do you have a specific place in mind?
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-
Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I���ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]
What���s up, guys? Just thought we���d have a little rap session, talk about business���see how things are going? Ahem���
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together. [Andy plays video]
What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn���t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ���Where were you when the girls came?���
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
I���m not going to take it. And then he���s going to be like ���whoa this is a really important meeting���.
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
���ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
Yeah and we���re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you���d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?
Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
OF course not.  There���s no magic button.  You have to summon that.
[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
What if you���re being attacked by a 4���11��� man who is penisless?
[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?
Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
Carla Fern is not just an actor���s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I���m all for it.
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
Hey, what���s goin��� on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young���uns?
Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
What if you���re being attacked by a ��� smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
[singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
Do you know why you never heard of it?
Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell]
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.
Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs]
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
You're asking him to give up all of his power.
Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
[waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks!
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out ���you suck my nutz��� from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say 'aye']
No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
[on computer screen] Ah, what else? I���ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
I���m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it���s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.
Neither am I, it���s already done.  Hah, I���m just kidding, it���s going to take some time.
Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.
I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
Here it is, you should draw a picture...
I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]
Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?
No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It���s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That���s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.
[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I���m gonna thank people.
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.
[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]
I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
[sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
What are you gonna play mange on faster?
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
I���m delivering it from the fridge. It���s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!
My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]
[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now��� [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
I need to talk to you in private.
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Alright fine.  You know what ��� I guess this place just hasn���t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I���m still going.  And I���m not going to ask anymore.  I���m not even going to look back.  I���m just going to assume that you���re with me.
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
No, I'm just testing if he can hear.
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.
[on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
OK, keep in mind, it���s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points���.or best offer.
Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ���no��� not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I���m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
Are you sure this is the right way?
[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
Dwight why don���t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -
But I just���it���s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn���t���
The male is a funny species. We don���t just tell each other how we feel, that���s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ���Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don���t want you to leave.��� You say something like, ���Hey, Andy, you���re making the worst mistake of your life. You���re not talented.��� Well��� right back at you, Darryl.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...
When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
I'm not asking for one, I need it.
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
Why did we pretend like we work here?
Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why��� Toby is giving us self defense training.
Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
Bah���I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They���re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
No. It���s a job. Things are going great.
With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.
Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
[deep voice] Listen, I don���t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I���ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
Ok.  Erin I think you know I���ve been dating someone.
Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.
Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
Yeah, but here���s the thing. I can���t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I���ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area]
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here?
No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
I'm like a quarter of the way through.
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he���s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he���s hard to love, but did you know that he���s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
Doesn���t mean you���re the best singer ever. Dick.
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'
Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
She���s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we���re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call���Dwight���
After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
That���s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete���s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
You didn���t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now���s your chance! I���m here. You got Qs; I got As.
I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs]
No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look]
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what���s up? Back in the small pond?
That���s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'
I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
Oscar says ���hi��� all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ���Hi��� ���Hello��� ���Hola��� You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ���hi���?
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car]
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Not my slaves, my ancestors���. Maybe. Probably not.
And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?
[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you���re amazing, okay? You���re obviously gonna be on the show, so it���s someone else���s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I���m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.
0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
Well, I think down���s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you���re talking about?
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ���.Confession: I don���t know what I���m doing.
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
You just use whichever one is sitting there?
They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar���s friend walks up] Not anything.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
I���m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor]
Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert���man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how���s the sales doubling ���project going?
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....
What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]
[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
I���ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.
Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.
After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
Dude, you struck out.  They're totally stuck up.  Here... drink up.
I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That���s what you did with this trip.
Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'
I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side���s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I���m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.
Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
So how do you want, how should I do it?
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I���m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog���had to pull rank.
This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.
No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''
[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in]
Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it���s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]
[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I���ll hold. I���m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture���
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]
Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you.
Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
And it���s getting a little more serious.  She���s never come by.
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That���s what I call the sun now.
[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.
And it was open. And people saw this. And they���re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
C���mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.
Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.
Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
Darryl said, ���Cool, man.��� He called me as cool man.
You never told me you were in high-school!
If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
Yeah, it was. That���s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords!
Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.
Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn���t help.
[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
[looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]
[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
Swear to God, hope to die. Now let���s get to work!
Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.
Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.
Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
Ooh I didn���t mean to offend you, and I hope you���ll forgive me because I am very very��� Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
���..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'
Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good.
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe��� you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'
[opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.  We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.  Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.  Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider]  Yeees!  [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted.
Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
[on the computer] You���re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
No, this is my time! You don���t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
No I���m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn���t, I���m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don���t like to throw around the b-word, but I���m going to be a huge bitch to you.
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
Nope. I have made up my mind. I���m really sorry.
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin']
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
It really looks great.  You did a great job.
Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
I didn't.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.
Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
What are you gonna do with all this time?
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
Whoa! Mind blown. It���s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
I guess it's starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]
She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling]
Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause]
Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
[to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?
[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.
Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael���s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I���m so not prepared.
My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
Okay. Robert���s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
[applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
[at same time as Kevin] I did it.
I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
Even without an audience you���re still at it.
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Are you insane? It���s the Cornell fight song.
Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
I know, I know that you're proud of me.
Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I���
It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
I���ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm���.
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute 'break a legs' or 'I still love you' type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.
[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
You humiliated me in front of every body!
Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
There���s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
Ah! That���s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.
I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don���t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I���m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.
It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
No, best thing that ever happened to me.
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.
It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ���move on���. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.
Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don't let me die here.
Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.
Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo���hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing��� no traditions!
Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ���95. Hey there, um, I���m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here���De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale���uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I���m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
What happened? What can I do to help?
Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don���t���it just��� I owe it to myself and my future fans.
Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down.
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
I���ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
I don't care, that's how much I swear!
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
[looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
[shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
[singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
[throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
And come and tell me. Doesn���t matter what it is.
You don���t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you���ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
There���s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales���
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz.
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
Oh! Seven new comments. ���The guy at 0:19 is hawt!��� [typing] ���Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!���[reading] ���He's not hawt, he's gay.��� [typing] ���Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.��� [reading] ���He is hawt!��� See, thank you, that's more like it. ���He is butt.��� God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
I wasn���t fired. What are you talking about? I���m fired up, yes. Guys, I���m���I���m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
And this is where I will record your sales.
I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.
[interrupting contestant singing ���Beautiful��� by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You���re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You���re like, my three favorite people ever.
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
Are you factoring in the��� whole national ���economy���. declining and all that?
Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.
Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]
Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
[Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon'
Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
If I am not Boner Champ, I don���t know who I am.
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
[stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]
I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles]
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.
See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It���s Clark and, um���
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus' Party in the USA]
Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.
[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
No, I did not.  Was that any good?
Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
They already have a contract? [Reading] ���Mutually agree to-��� Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
What are you still doing not at your desk?
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?
I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn���t.  [to Robert] I���m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
I didn't know you were going to be here.
Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
[outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
Uh, dream. Goin��� with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn���t that right, Jim?
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.
Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
