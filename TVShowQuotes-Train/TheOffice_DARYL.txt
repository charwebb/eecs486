So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
I impressed her with my good ideas.
Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?
Yeah, sell!
Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Absolutely.
They only want it for the initials.
It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you.

Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
Are you serious?
Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
I wish, but uh-
You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
[Michael walks into disarray of people's reactions to the TV going out] Where you been?
Not bad, huh?
Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it.
[to Andy] Take a shot.
Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom.  All right then, uh, let me get to it.
And I'd blow your mind.
Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
Thank you.
Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.
[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think?
