Absolutely.
I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
Not bad, huh?
And I'd blow your mind.
Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it.
Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
Yeah, sell!
Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you.
Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
Thank you.
Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.

Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
They only want it for the initials.
Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
I impressed her with my good ideas.
It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you.
So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
Cable's out.
What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
I wish, but uh-
