Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.
Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it.
What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?
So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you.
Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom.  All right then, uh, let me get to it.
[opens the door the Ryan's office, grabs him by the shirt, pulls him out of his chair] Consider it a WUPHF in person. [shoves Ryan down to a chair]
Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
[Michael walks into disarray of people's reactions to the TV going out] Where you been?
I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
