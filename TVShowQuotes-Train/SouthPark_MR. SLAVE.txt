Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!

Yeah, Jesus Christ.

Oooo, this could be kind of fun. 

Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.

Jesus Christ!

That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!

Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.

Almost. I just have to get through a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.

Oh Jesus!  Kids, kids!

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?

Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.

Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.

Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months.

Yeth Jethuth yeth!

Unh, Jesus  Christ.

Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?

Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.

Jesus! Jesus Christ!

Jesus.  Ohoho, Jesus. 

Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.

Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.

Oh Jesus Christ.

I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.

Ooooo...

Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?

Yes, Mr. Garrison?

Oh, Jesus Christ.

As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.

Oh, Jesus Christ! 

We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.

AAH.

Jesus Christ.

Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?

Jesus. 

Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. 

Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! 

Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!

Hear hear!

Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.

This room's taken.

Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ. 

Ugh.

So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?

Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth!

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Hi kids. Hm.

The principal didn't fire you?

Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous.

But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!

How can you say that?! You're gay too!

All donesy wunsy. 

AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!

Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!

Oh! Jesus Christ! 

We wanna be treated equally!

Oh, hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?

How did you do that?

Girls, what on earth are you doing?

Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.

Ooooo, Jesus Christ. 

Eugh, Jesus Christ. 

It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!

People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the-  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.

No thanks.

I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?

Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ. 

Oh, Jesus Christ

Thank you sweetie.

Oh, Jesus Christ.
