Almost. I just have to get through a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.
Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.
Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ. 
How can you say that?! You're gay too!
Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?
Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! 
Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!
I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.
Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!
Oh, hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous.
Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!
As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.
Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.
Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?
Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.
People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the-  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.
So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?
We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.
Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months.
Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.
Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.
Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.
Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?
