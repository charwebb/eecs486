Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! 

Oh, Jesus Christ

Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!

Oooo, this could be kind of fun. 

A what?! For God's sake, where?!

Jesus Christ.

Ugh.

How did you do that?

Eugh, Jesus Christ. 

Jesus. 

Almost. I just have to get through a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.

Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.

Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.

All donesy wunsy. 

Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?

Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.

Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?

No thanks.

This room's taken.

How'd it go?

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Yes, Mr. Garrison?

Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?

We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the-  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.

Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ. 

Oh, Jesus Christ! 

AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!

Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months.

Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. 

As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.

Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.

The principal didn't fire you?

Ooooo...

Unh, Jesus  Christ.

Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!

Jesus! Jesus Christ!

Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.

Jesus Christ!

But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!

Hear hear!

Yeth Jethuth yeth!

Oh! Jesus Christ! 

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Thank you sweetie.

I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.

Oh Jesus Christ.

How can you say that?! You're gay too!

So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?

That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!

Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.

Girls, what on earth are you doing?

No!  Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married.

Yeah, Jesus Christ.

Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.

Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!

Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous.

Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Hi kids. Hm.

Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.

It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!

We wanna be treated equally!

AAH.

Jesus.  Ohoho, Jesus. 

Ooooo, Jesus Christ. 

I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?

Oh Jesus Christ.

Oh, hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
