Decks??

Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?

Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.

Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.

Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.

Make love to me, Randy. Please!

The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.

That's right!

Husband? You're not my husband.

But we have to free Hat.

This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.

Look, I can see him. 

Mr. President, we need your final approval code.

Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?

We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.

Oh nooo! 

Eh, heheheheheheh.

Paul! 

Wha?!

Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi. 

I'm a pirate in a war.

They killed him! We can come out!

Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?

I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!

My monvert's never looked so clean. 

Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!

Oui. 

Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.

"Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."

You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.

No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 

Cartman, I want youuu!

It's out of control.

Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!

Uh, what are you going to do to us??

What's the matter with it?

Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.

Well, how do you know he didn't?

Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.

Are you okay, hon?

Oh darling, it's wonderful.

Everything all right, Fred?

Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.

Ew, I almost stepped in it.

Oh my Goooood, help meeee! 

Bonjour.

Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. 

Oh goodness, what happened?

Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!

Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? 

Oh, I don't know.

Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.

Oh he's so adorable.

We're doing free personality tests today.

I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.

Ooooh. 

Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.

We don't have a captain!

Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! 

Can I help you?

We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?

Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!

Oh, huhuh.

Does that little boy have a gun?

(Aaaaaah!)

Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.

Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?

Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!

Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.

Runs with Premise, come quickly!

Nothing. Why?

I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. 

Hallelujah!

The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?

No, please!

Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 

What's happening??

I'll take two.

Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 

We've gotta do something!

Oooh.

Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?

Air it! 

Hey, he's got a point there.

Oh my God!

Huh, I never. 

Well what about lesbians?!

But they will find him.

My God, that's disgusting!

Make love to me, Randy. Please!

For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 

What??

Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?

It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!" But I don't think he feels it.

Chris, will you sit down?

Your... mom told you?

Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!

Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.

Here you go, Robby. 

Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.

Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!

What are you going to do to us??

How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!

Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.

You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 

We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.

Take a picture of the sound, Steven. 

Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?

There has to be a town around here somewhere.

Mr. President, we need final authorization!

Who is that lady?

Hello? Is anybody here? 

Yeah, let's get this party started. 

This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!

Oh my God.

Let's flip it over!

What?  Mr. President, are you sure? 

Oh.

Am I going to spontaneously combust?

Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. 

Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.

Yes, Lorry.

Oh, you people make me sick! 

Frances Velman.

Oh! What darling little children.

...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...

He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!

Oh my Gooodd!

I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!

Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.

No! I love you! I love you back! 

Hello-o. 

Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.

Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 

I'm Allyson.

We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!

Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.

Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.

Whoa

We don't care about that.

I don't know, uh. I guess nothing.

Dehhhnyihhhs! 

Five seconds, Mr. President! 

You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??

Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.

Why not?!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH

Bene, Benedicali!  La morte rossa! 

But-

Thank you very much.

I'm so confused, babe.

Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!

Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! 

Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 

Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.

Oh my God, did he...?

Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?

A little closer!

Please! Don't take me away from my child!

No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!

How about fifteen dollars?

It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.

Yes.

Yes?

I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.

Mr. President, we need a decision now!

Paul. Paul! 

Can I help you?

What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.

Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.

The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.

We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.

Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.

AAAAAH!

Do you kids like magic?

Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?

Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.

...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.

Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.

Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 

Oh my God!

It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.

You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.

Oh he's such a happy little Mexican.
