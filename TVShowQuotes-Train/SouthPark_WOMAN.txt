Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
What are you going to do to us??
Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.
Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! 
"Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."
Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 
How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?
...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.
Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.
Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.
Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. 
Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?
Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.
This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
Please! Don't take me away from my child!
We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!
Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.
The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. 
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.
He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.
No! I love you! I love you back! 
I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!
I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.
Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. 
Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.
..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 
Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.
Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.
Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?
It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!" But I don't think he feels it.
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.
Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? 
Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 
Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 
Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?
It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.
Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 
Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Uh, what are you going to do to us??
Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?
Oh my God look out it's a Mexican!
