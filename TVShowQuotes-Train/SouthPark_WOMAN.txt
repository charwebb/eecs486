Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
There has to be a town around here somewhere.
"Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."
Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?
Please! Don't take me away from my child!
Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.
Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.
Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. 
Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?
I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.
Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?
Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 
It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?
Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! 
We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!
Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.
Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 
Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?
This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.
That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.
For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! 
Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.
Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.
Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 
The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.
Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.
It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!" But I don't think he feels it.
..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 
We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
Mr. President, we need your final approval code.
This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.
Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.
Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.
How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.
Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.
No! I love you! I love you back! 
What are you going to do to us??
He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. 
Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 
Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.
I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.
Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?
Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
