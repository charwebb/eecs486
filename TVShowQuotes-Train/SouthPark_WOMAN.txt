Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.

Oh goodness, what happened?

Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 

Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. 

Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! 

It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!" But I don't think he feels it.

Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.

Well what about lesbians?!

I'll take two.

Nothing. Why?

Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.

No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!

Oh! What darling little children.

Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!

Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi. 

Yes, Lorry.

Eh, heheheheheheh.

This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!

What's happening??

Well, how do you know he didn't?

Oh, huhuh.

You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 

No! I love you! I love you back! 

Hey, he's got a point there.

Oh he's so adorable.

It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.

I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.

No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 

Air it! 

Leslie, I'm with Buck now. 

Frances Velman.

We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.

I don't know, uh. I guess nothing.

Oui. 

Mr. President, we need a decision now!

Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?

We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!

We're doing free personality tests today.

Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.

Why not?!

For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 

It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.

Am I going to spontaneously combust?

That's right!

I'm Allyson.

Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.

Look, I can see him. 

Here you go, Robby. 

Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.

This is very scary.

Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!

Paul. Paul! 

Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?

Your... mom told you?

Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!

Runs with Premise, come quickly!

Chris, will you sit down?

Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.

Make love to me, Randy. Please!

We've gotta do something!

Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.

Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.

How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!

Husband? You're not my husband.

What is that kid doing?

You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.

Oh my God.

Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?

Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.

Are you okay, hon?

I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.

Oh, you people make me sick! 

Hello-o. 

What's the matter with it?

Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?

Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.

We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.

I'm a pirate in a war.

Eeeek! Eeeeeek!

Can I help you?

What are you going to do to us??

Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.

Hello?  WAAH!  Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! 

Bene, Benedicali!  La morte rossa! 

The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.

..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!

Let's flip it over!

Please! Don't take me away from my child!

I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!

Cartman, I want youuu!

Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.

Decks??

Bonjour.

Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?

Yes?

Oohh, they're so beautiful.

He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!

We don't care about that.

Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.

My God, that's disgusting!

Hallelujah!

I'm so confused, babe.

Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! 

"Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."

Five seconds, Mr. President! 

Oh, huhuh. 

Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.

It's out of control.

Ew, I almost stepped in it.

Oooh.

Can I help you?

What??

It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.

Take a picture of the sound, Steven. 

Dehhhnyihhhs! 

My monvert's never looked so clean. 

Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 

You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.

We don't have a captain!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH

I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.

What?

...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.

That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.

Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. 

We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.

Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.

Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?

Ooooh. 

Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?

Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 

I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. 

Does that little boy have a gun?

Oh my God, did he...?

Oh my God!

Oh my Gooodd!

Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.

AAAAAH!

Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.

(Aaaaaah!)

The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.

Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 

You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??

Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.

I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!

Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Burn him! Burn the towel!

The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?

Oh darling, it's wonderful.

There has to be a town around here somewhere.

Oh.

Paul! 

This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.

Oh my Goooood, help meeee! 

They killed him! We can come out!

Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.

I can't believe these bargains.

Oh nooo! 

Wha?!

Huh, I never. 

No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!

Do you kids like magic?

Uh, what are you going to do to us??

Oh, I don't know.

Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 

Make love to me, Randy. Please!

Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.

What?  Mr. President, are you sure? 

Thank you very much.

Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 

Oh my God!

But we have to free Hat.

A little closer!

But they will find him.

Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!

Yes.

Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?

Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.

Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?

Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!

Hello? Is anybody here? 

Mr. President, we need your final approval code.

Richard, this is Grandma.

Mr. President, we need final authorization!
