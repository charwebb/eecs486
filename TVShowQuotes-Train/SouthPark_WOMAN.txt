Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
Please! Don't take me away from my child!
Mr. President, we need your final approval code.
What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.
Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.
Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.
We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?
It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!" But I don't think he feels it.
Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?
Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?
I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. 
Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. 
Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.
You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!
This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
What are you going to do to us??
Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! 
Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 
Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
"Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."
Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! 
You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 
Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. 
You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.
Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? 
Uh, what are you going to do to us??
This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.
Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?
It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?
The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.
That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.
Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.
Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
There has to be a town around here somewhere.
Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.
Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 
The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
No! I love you! I love you back! 
Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 
Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 
Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them?
