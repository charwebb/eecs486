This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! 
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 
Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!
Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!
My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!! 
Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!
...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!
What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day! 
Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
Why would I take the princess of Canada?
It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!
Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 
You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. 
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!
Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! 
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! 
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 
Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance! 
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer"
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 
Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! 
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
