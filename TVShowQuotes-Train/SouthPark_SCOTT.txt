Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say "I beg you to give me back my money."

What do you want?

Goddammit!

Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!

Hello?

"Here's my snout."

Hey.

...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!

Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.

Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! 

You really went? What a 'tard.

You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.

But... just one thing before I give it to you:

Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.

Here you go.

Why would I take the princess of Canada?

What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!

What are you idiots doing?!

My... mom and dad are... dead? 

It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! 

Who took you, Princess?!

You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--

What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!

Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.

You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!

Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?

Say it!

Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! 

Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!

Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!

Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!

Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!

'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-

How do you know?

I'm proud of you, too, Mom.

No reason.

Thennn why are you telling me?

All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer"
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!

They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!

Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 

No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!

Who the hell are you?!

Hello?

See ya. 

Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!

No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.

Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! 

Uh huh.

Sure. 

Oh my God!  Oh my God!! 

I thought you were from Iraq.

Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!

How can I turn it down?

Eh, it's a special recipe.

This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day! 

Yes! In the head!

I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!! 

Who is this?

What?!

Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.

Jesus!

Sure. 

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 

The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!

Aaah God ow sorry...

Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance! 

They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.

The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-

Nothing, why?

Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.

Uh uh, I don't take returns!

Ehhh...

Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?

Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!

What do you want?!

That is correct, yes, I do.

If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.

Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!

What?

En garde! 

You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?

Yeah, we don't like it!

She'll kiss anybody?

Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.

There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.

Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?

That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.

Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.

Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!

It's the princess!

It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.

Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 

Ey! What are you doing?!

You're a dick.

That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. 

He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!

Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.

Buyer beware, dude!

Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.

The Native Canadians.

Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.

Have you no heart??

Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?

This deal's getting worse all the time.

Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 

I'm wishing cancer upon you.

Ah!

Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.

A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!

Yess, yes it is.

You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!

Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.

Do you want your grandma to live or not?!

Haha, you lose, Americans!

Well, you must do it for Canada.

You're a dick.

Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!

No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!

You're a dick.

The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.

Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?

You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 

And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 

Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.

I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.

Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.

You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!

Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?

Hey! What the hell is going on?!

There!

Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!

How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?

Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?

Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.

Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.

This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 

Saddam Hussein?! The Iraqi dictator?

Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!

Speak of the devil! What do you want?

Oh, so now I'm a dick!

Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.

Terrance, this is Scott.

AAAH! 

What the?  You did it, kid!

I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!

Jeaaaaah!

I actually have plans this weekend.

Oh.

And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! 

Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.

Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.

Hehere, take your money!

You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!

You're a dick.

Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!

My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!! 

I'm not sure I should trust you.

Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour! 

Now say, "I'm a little piggy."

Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.

Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.

What's so bad about hanging out with me?

This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!

Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 

I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.

Your grandma?

Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.

What's so funny!

Of course!

Awesome! 

No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer! 

What?  Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! 

Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
