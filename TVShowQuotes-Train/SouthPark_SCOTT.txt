Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 
If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!
Why would I take the princess of Canada?
Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. 
What?  Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! 
It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!! 
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer"
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-
The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 
Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer! 
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!
Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!
Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 
This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! 
Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! 
Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! 
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.
Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!
Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day! 
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance! 
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 
Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!
What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
