Awesome! 

Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.

What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!

You're a dick.

Ah!

It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.

Hello?

The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!

Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?

Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!

Haha, you lose, Americans!

You really went? What a 'tard.

Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.

There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.

Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!

Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?

Hehere, take your money!

You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!

Yes! In the head!

Your grandma?

Why would I take the princess of Canada?

Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?

Yeah, we don't like it!

And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! 

There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??

What?

AAAH!Â 

Nothing, why?

Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?

Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?

No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!

What the?  You did it, kid!

But... just one thing before I give it to you:

I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.

Who the hell are you?!

See ya. 

Eh, it's a special recipe.

'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-

Buyer beware, dude!

Goddammit!

What do you want?

This deal's getting worse all the time.

Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! 

I'm proud of you, too, Mom.

Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.

You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--

This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!

Speak of the devil! What do you want?

The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.

He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!

Aaah God ow sorry...

Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.

Of course!

Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.

It's the princess!

Who took you, Princess?!

Here you go.

You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!

No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!

She'll kiss anybody?

You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?

Oh.

Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!

That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.

Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.

No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer! 

That is correct, yes, I do.

What?!

Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.

They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.

Yess, yes it is.

How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?

How can I turn it down?

Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.

Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.

Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.

Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!

How do you know?

Oh my God!  Oh my God!! 

What's so bad about hanging out with me?

Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?

The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.

Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 

You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!

...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!

You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 

I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!! 

Hey guys. Hey guys! 

Oh! That is so juvenile! 

Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.

Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.

Not so fast! 

You're a dick.

Sure. 

Have you no heart??

All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer"
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!

Jesus!

Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!

You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 

There!

My... mom and dad are... dead? 

What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!

Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! 

Terrance, this is Scott.

Uh huh.

What's so funny!

Uh uh, I don't take returns!

Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!

Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!

Well, you must do it for Canada.

You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!

I'm wishing cancer upon you.

Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say "I beg you to give me back my money."

"Oink oink oink."

I told you I have to eat every two hours.

Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.

Oh, so now I'm a dick!

Say it!

This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day! 

Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.

You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.

No reason.

Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?

Sure. 

It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! 

What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?

That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. 

Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!

Ehhh...

I actually have plans this weekend.

Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour! 

Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!

Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.

No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.

Do you want your grandma to live or not?!

Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 

I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!

This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 

And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 

Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!

Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!

Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance! 

Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 

Hey! What the hell is going on?!

What?  Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! 

Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.

The Native Canadians.

Now say, "I'm a little piggy."

Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!

Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!

The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-

Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! 

If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.

Thennn why are you telling me?

Who is this?

Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.

Saddam Hussein?! The Iraqi dictator?

Hey.

I just... well... I want you to beg for it.

A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!

What do you want?!

Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?

Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.

Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.

Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.

My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!! 

Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 

I thought you were from Iraq.

Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.

Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.

Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!

Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
