Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance! 
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!
Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer"
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!
Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!
No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer! 
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!
Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour! 
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.
There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??
Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
What?  Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! 
You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! 
Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 
'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! 
That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!! 
Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! 
Why would I take the princess of Canada?
You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!
Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. 
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!
