Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 
Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
Go on, take your son for a walk.
Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. 
We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 
That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command.
So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.
No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 
Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 
See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 
I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
