See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.
See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.
You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command.
You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. 
Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 
Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 
So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
Go on, take your son for a walk.
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 
This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 
Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
