See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.

Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 

Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?

Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.

You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. 

Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.

So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?

Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.

Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.

Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.

Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 

Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command.

You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.

Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.

This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.

No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.

See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.

I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-

I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.

Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 

Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.

It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.

Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.

No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 

Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 

Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.

I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 

You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.

Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.

We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.

This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.

So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?

See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.

I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 

Go on, take your son for a walk.

That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.

We need him to become relaxed and submissive.

See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
