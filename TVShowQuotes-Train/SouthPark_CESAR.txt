See?

Tsst.

Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.

No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.

See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.

See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.

Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.

Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.

Tsst.

Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.

How is the child doing?

Oh look it came back.

Tsst.

Tsst.

Tsst.

This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.

Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?

Tsst. 

We need him to become relaxed and submissive.

Well let's feed it.

Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!

See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.

Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.

It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.

So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?

So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.

You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. 

It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.

So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?

Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 

You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.

Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 

Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 

How is the painting going?

Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.

I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 

Tsst. 

Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.

See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.

That's greeat!

Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.

You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.

I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-

I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.

Go on, take your son for a walk.

I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 

Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.

Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?

Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 

Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.

This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
