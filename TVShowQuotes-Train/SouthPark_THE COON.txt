That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.

That's it! 

You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that "Who Is The Coon?" T-shirt I gave you?

Let her go!

Yes, I have to go now.  But in the meantime I have something that might interest you.  Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!

I'm not on his side!

I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. 

Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.

Come out where I can see you!

Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!

Don't worry, Mysterion!  The Coon will now help you!

So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!

How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!

Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. 

I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!

That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!

Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.

Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.

Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?

Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.  I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.

Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!

Get out of here! Get to safety! 

You aren't raping anyone tonight!

I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.

Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!

No, I'm not that kid!

If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?

Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!

I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.

Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city.  And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are-  Who the hell is that?  Who the hell are you?

You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!

Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?

Yes, it's fine!

There was another rapist in the park tonight.  It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top.

NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!

What do you mean "continued"? You don't know who I am!

Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.

Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.

A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.

Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!

I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.

You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?!  Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! 

Now I'm back over here.

No, I'm no- I  I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!

You guys have your own storage facility?

Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs!  Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!

N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.

Because Mysterion is trying to  You fucker, that fuckin' hurt!  Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!

No, I'm just over here now.  What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?

Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!

Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!

I had no choice.  I was at the end of my rope.  Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.
