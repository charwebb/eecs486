This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it.
Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again.
Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady. 
Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.  Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...
Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?
Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class.
Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.  Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.
Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!
Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?
Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha  hahahaha!  Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones.  Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared.
Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?
And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!
Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.  E-yes, what is it?
Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A.
Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?
Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.
