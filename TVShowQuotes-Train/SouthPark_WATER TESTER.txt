One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
I think that would be a very bad idea.
I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now ninety eight percent pee.
We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.
Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.
Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.
You're endangering people's lives!  If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!
Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.
All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey.  We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. 
Let's hope to Christ this works.  No, damn it, no!
