The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.

No, just need to pee.

Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. 

Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!

Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! 

Allyson always goes for the butch ones.

Oh my God!

Arrrggghh! 

I've got balls! 

Hai. 

Sure. Would you like to see mine?

Uh, marching's really not for me.

Come on, hurry up.

Did you see that shit? 

Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's "straaange."

Hey, how are you?

Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world.

Eeeeeeeek! 

And I broke the dam.

Hi

Yeah, but for how long?

For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.

Hey Allyson.

Look out! 

You done spilled that on my titties, skank! 

Mmm.

Oh Jesus, no!

Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died. 

It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. 

Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it? 

It it sure is.

Oh Mark, I love you.

The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!

Nooooo! 

EEK!

We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.

Hope.

Maybe he's okay.

Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.

It feels really good in my hands.

We're pirates.
