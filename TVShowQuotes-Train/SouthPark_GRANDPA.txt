God damnit, what the hell are they doing?!
Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man.
Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?
Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. .
No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!
Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary.

Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha.
Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.
That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more McGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?

A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! 
Damnit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!
They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado.
Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- 
God damnit! Now we have to start over!
It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. 
Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son.
