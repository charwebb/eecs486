The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!

A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.

Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary. 

Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!

Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!

Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- 

Well, it's good for 'im.

Nice thinkin', Billy.

Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha.

Got everything you need there, do ya?

Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?

Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. .

No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more McGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?

Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man.

Look at how big you've gotten!

You bastards!

Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.

Pull the trigger, you little pussy!

You're damn right she's tired.

Huh?

It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. 

No wonder she didn't say good-night.

What the hell?

I wanna die. 

Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! 

What?!  Oh, dear Jesus!

God damnit! Now we have to start over!

No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!

Y'don't say. 

They're quite agile little things, aren't they?

You...

God damnit, what the hell are they doing?!

Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.

Ah.  Oh.  Ah!  Oh.  Oh-oooh-oooh!

Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son.

That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.

Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family.

Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders.

Damnit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!

...remember any of that stuff, do ya?
