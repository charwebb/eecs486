Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
[laughs uproariously]
Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
Shut up!
I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.
Alright.
Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
I have a full day of sales calls.
Well, no. I got nothing.
You didn't order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
Cookies. Bet you anything it���s cookies.
Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
Sit on the throne, Michael.
And what kind of stripper did you get?
You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
[Breaks pencil.]
Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
It was pretty big.
Left it in the middle of your office.
That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
Drama queen, am I right?
Still queer?
This is great. This is gonna be great.
Quick query, Halpert.
Your mom, you gay nerd!
Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.
What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
Special delivery!
I will be here.
Thank you.
Just get one for the girls too.  That evens it out.  You know, separate but equal.
Not good enough (clicks tongue)
Yeah.
I'll be there at 6:00
What happened?
They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
No.
That's great.
Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
You can't put me down. Too strong!
Shut it!
-features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.
Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
Quick somebody help!  Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael]
I can do it.
