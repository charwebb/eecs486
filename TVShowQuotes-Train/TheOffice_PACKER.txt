Shut up!
Alright.
Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
[laughs uproariously]
Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
I have a full day of sales calls.
Halpert!  Tall, queer, handsome as ever.  Hey everybody it's me, Jim.  Hello, hello.  Todd Packer.
Sit on the throne, Michael.
I'll be there at 6:00
Quick query, Halpert.
Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
[Breaks pencil.]
Shut it!

Yeah.
You can't put me down. Too strong!
That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.
It would be an honor, ma'am.
Well, no. I got nothing.
Left it in the middle of your office.
Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
It was pretty big.
Special delivery!
That's great.
Quick somebody help!  Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael]
Thank you.
Just get one for the girls too.  That evens it out.  You know, separate but equal.
You didn't order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
I will be here.
And what kind of stripper did you get?
Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101.  If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.
I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.
No.
Cookies. Bet you anything it���s cookies.
Did you say 'masturbator?'
They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Your mom, you gay nerd!
Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
Still queer?
What happened?
Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
