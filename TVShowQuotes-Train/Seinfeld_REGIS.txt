You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books!
I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?
It's a coffee table book about coffee tables! (holds the book up for the audience)
Can I bring out our next guest now?
Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome Kramer!
Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!
Ya he is, he's a nice looking guy.
I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?
Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?
Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -
