(counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?
Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.

Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars.
