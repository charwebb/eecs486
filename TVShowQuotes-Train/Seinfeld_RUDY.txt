(coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.
That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.
(counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.
Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?
I don't see what would possibly stop me.
Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.
You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.
I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.
Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.
