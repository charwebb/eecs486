He said that you got a head start.
. . . Why did you cheat in that race?
I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me.
Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?
Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.
Why don't the two of you just race again?
If he beats you I want a big raise.
So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?
Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry?
You really like to say my name? Don't you?
Have you designed any buildings in New York?
