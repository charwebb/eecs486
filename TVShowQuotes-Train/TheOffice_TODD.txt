[to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
[shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Since when did you learn how to read?
Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
[grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!
[walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the 'ass', in Tallahassee!
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
[at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
Hey, did you get that package I left for you?
Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
