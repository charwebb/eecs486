Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
Check it out!
Is too!
[at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Uh, it doesn���t include headshots.
You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Why?
Why?
She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
Since when did you learn how to read?
[to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Well thanks, will do.
[shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
Holly said that?
That's sweet. How's the sex?
I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Don't give up on me.
After you!
It's gonna be so good.
All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
No.
[excitedly] Oh!
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
That sounds weird.
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
