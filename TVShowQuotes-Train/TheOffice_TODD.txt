Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
Check it out!
I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Don't give up on me.
She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Do you have a ball and chain?
Since when did you learn how to read?
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
It's gonna be so good.
Uh, it doesn���t include headshots.
That's sweet. How's the sex?
Why?
Why?
You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
That sounds weird.
[walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the 'ass', in Tallahassee!
[excitedly] Oh!
[to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
Holly said that?
[grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
No.
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
[at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
After you!
I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Well thanks, will do.
Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
