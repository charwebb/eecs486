Hehummm.. JIM...Can I see you for a second
I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
Well , we've discussed this, here's the feeling. You got a greeting starts with an H how's twenty bucks sound.
Thanks, thanks everybody. (they leave) Sir, have a seat.
(to kramer) Can you excuse us for one minute. Just one minute.
Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?
All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go!
(To a waiting Elaine) Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.
That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.
We have a wide variety of Gene picks.
Yeah... Hum..Jim , a man here says came in the other day , you didn't say hello?
(Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?
Then you are entitled to a hundred dollars. That's our policy.
Did you want to speak with the manager?
Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.
Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.
NO, I"m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.
