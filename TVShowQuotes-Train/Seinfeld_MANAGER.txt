Then you are entitled to a hundred dollars. That's our policy.
What happened?
That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.
(Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?
Who are you?
