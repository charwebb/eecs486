That's a tough one.
Thanks, thanks everybody. (they leave) Sir, have a seat.

Thanks. (they huddle)
We have a wide variety of Gene picks.
Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?
That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.
Yea....hum......He'll be. hum.. right over.(awkward pause)
Sorry to the disturbance.
Alright. That's enough. You're fired.
Then you are entitled to a hundred dollars. That's our policy.
All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go!
