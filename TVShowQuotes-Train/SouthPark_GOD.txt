Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children. 
I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000. 
Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.
Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here.
Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.
You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
It was nice to see you again, Satan.
What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.
You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
What did you expect me to look like, My son?
I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.
No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.
You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man â€” with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven.
