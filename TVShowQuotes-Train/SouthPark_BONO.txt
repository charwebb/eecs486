Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. 
I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much.  Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award.  Yes?
Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.
I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. 
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
