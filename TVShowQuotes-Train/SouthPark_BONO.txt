Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. 
I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. 
Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much.  Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award.  Yes?
