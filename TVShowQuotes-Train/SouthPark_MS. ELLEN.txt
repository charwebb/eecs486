Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.  Cartman?
Are there any questions before we begin?  Yes, Wendy?
Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!  We're like sisters!
Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.
Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.
Egh.  This is all a mistake!  This can't be happening!  Pleease! For the love of God!
Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired.
And here's another present...from Wendy.  Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.  Thank you, Wendy .
Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.
Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.  Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,  but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us. 
That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-
Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me  Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle. 
Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now.  But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner. 
That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?
Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?  Well, where did he leave off?
I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.
And here's one from Kenny.  Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.  Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.
Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?
Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan.
All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-
Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?
Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?
