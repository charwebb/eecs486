Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired.
Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan.
I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.
And here's another present...from Wendy.  Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.  Thank you, Wendy .
Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?
Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?  Well, where did he leave off?
All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-
Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!  We're like sisters!
Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?
Egh.  This is all a mistake!  This can't be happening!  Pleease! For the love of God!
Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life...
And here's one from Kenny.  Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.  Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.
Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.  Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,  but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us. 
Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?
That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-
Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?
Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me  Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle. 
Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.
Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.  Cartman?
Are there any questions before we begin?  Yes, Wendy?
Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.
Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.
