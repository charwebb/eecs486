Good morning, children. 

And here's another present...from Wendy.  Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.  Thank you, Wendy .

Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?  Well, where did he leave off?

Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.  Cartman?

Wwhat?!

Oh, that's okay, Wendy.

That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-

Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan.

It's a lie!

Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.

Nooo!

Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.  Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,  but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us. 

NOOOO!!  GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!

All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-

Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me  Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle. 

Really?

Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?

Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life...

Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.

Egh.  This is all a mistake!  This can't be happening!  Pleease! For the love of God!

Excuse me?

Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now.  But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner. 

Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?

Oh boy.

Wha?

I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.

Can I help you?

What are you talking about?

So you're alright?

Well first of all, you're eight.

Wel...sure!

And here's one from Kenny.  Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.  Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.

Of course, Wendy. 

Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired.

Principal Victoria, please.

Are there any questions before we begin?  Yes, Wendy?

Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.

Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?

Good morning, children.

Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.

Well, I would love that, Wendy.

Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!  We're like sisters!

Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!

NOOOOOOO!!

That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?

Stan, how about you?
