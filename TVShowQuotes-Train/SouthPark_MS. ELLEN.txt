Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!  We're like sisters!

Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired.

Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now.  But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner. 

All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-

Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.

Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life...

Can I help you?

Stan, how about you?

Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me  Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle. 

Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?  Well, where did he leave off?

I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.

Nooo!

Aand?

Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?

Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!

Hello, children. 

Wwhat?!

Are there any questions before we begin?  Yes, Wendy?

Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?

Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.  Cartman?

And here's one from Kenny.  Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.  Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.

That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-

Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.

Well, I would love that, Wendy.

Oh boy.

That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?

Of course, Wendy. 

NOOOOOOO!!

Of course, Wendy.

Well first of all, you're eight.

Excuse me?

And here's another present...from Wendy.  Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.  Thank you, Wendy .

Good morning, children. 

Really?

It's a lie!

So you're alright?

Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.  Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,  but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us. 

Good morning, children.

Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
