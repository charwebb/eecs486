Oh right! "The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students." That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!
Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh!  Aaaah! Oh it's bad!  Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH!  OW!
Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
So does, does this mean the storm is past. Global warming's over?
Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez.  Alright, get her the fuck out of here. 
But I don't think I really have a problem.
Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?
Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?
Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.  Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,  so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,  and when it gets back up to me,  we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you…
Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? 
M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?
M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!
And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?
You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at!  Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! 
Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
I think this will be very good for you 
Eric, do you feel better about all this?
Well students, why don't we uh-  Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole "dental hygiene" thing is so important to me.  Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?!  DO YOU?!
M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it "The Choking Game", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,
Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!
Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
Don't "Hello" us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So  what the hell are you gonna do about it?!
Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)
M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy?  Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?
It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.
Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria.  I think I may know what the problem is. 
I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. 
M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.
Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.
Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, mkay?
Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?
It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?
Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a  Ooowww, okay!  Ooohhh, it's bad!
Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?
Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.
M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. 
Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
I knew it would be funny someday!  AIDS!
Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next!  Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. 
And these... are the two areas most important to-
Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'.  Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! 
Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!
Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have. 
We have plenty enough to save our town now!
Nuh-now, who was that?  That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?
Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful! 
Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?
Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. Nde no no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. Yeeu be passive, mkay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.
No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that.
You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick. 
Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.
Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER n'kay!
We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, "Friends" . Ohokahay, huhuh.
Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...  I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??
Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys.  These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!
Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
At long last I have foundA true reason to beNow I feel I can start anew--  Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!  Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?
What do you have to say for yourself?!  Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh-  Did you just flip me off?
Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs.
Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, mkay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?
Huh. You you think the students would like that?
Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- 
Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!
Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel.  You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school.  Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls.
To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac  Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey! 
Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!
Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm...  Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?  Yeah, baby... The world is so small.  I'm free... I'm free...
Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.
Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change  how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right!  Pick it up from there!
But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, nkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?
Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!
We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.
Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)
What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?
Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.
Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?
Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students,  spearheaded by you, cause him-!
What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...
Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike," "N'kay!"
No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this  to work!
Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.
Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?
No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?
Oh, no problem.  Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?
M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?
M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
Okay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.  You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.  You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Okay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?  Yes, Stan?
Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay?  Would you like a meteor mai tai?
Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man!  You get sent here every day, Craig!
Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?
Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.  Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.
God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- 
Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? "The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.
You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? 
Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.
Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important.  This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.
See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.  M'kay?
Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground.
We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?
All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 
Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. 
The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all.  Do the other kids make fun of ya?
I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
Our students did average, maybe just below average.
Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! 
Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?
Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?!  It's worthless now!
Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, mkay? Not for immature skylarkings.
You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. 
Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay.
Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.
Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.
M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y".
Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? 
Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)
Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control.
You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
No! Now you listen to me!  IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!
Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer.  M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit! M'kay?! 
Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
Boys, what are you doing back here?  I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here!  What the?  Oh shit!  Stop that rat!
Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. 
Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!
Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? 
Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!
Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?  Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?  Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?  Uh-oh.
M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?!  Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal,  'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see.  Oh yeah, that's real funny!  I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! 
Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass.
Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!
Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? 
Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now. 
Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??
We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!
Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do!  He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!
I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu.  Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back.  Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off.  Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say "Hi", m'kay? 
How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 
Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now. 
Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, Eric.
Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay? 
No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? 
Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?
Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life... 
Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?
Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time.  Mkay?
Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay?  M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, "Butt Out!" 
Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
Oh that's good.  You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?
Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about "the diversity of Asian people." Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. 
But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it! Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
M'kay, interesting, Token, Uh... Who would like to go next?  Uh how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?
Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita?  Juanita?  We need some more finger sandwiches? 
Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay?  You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.
Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? 
Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.
And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh-  There! You just flipped me off again!
Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde?
Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. 
Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay.
I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.
M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "x = y + 1". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, nkay? This type of thing happens all the time.
You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. 
Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while. 
It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?
Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?
M'kay, that's good!  Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!
And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.
Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.
-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. 
Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston.
Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.
Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? 
Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay!  Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!
Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
Okay.  Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
Well-obviously something is bothering him.  Oh, of course!  My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, mkay?
…and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney…
It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? 
Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in.  I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?
No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay?  Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
He's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here?
Just a minute to go in the first quarter. 
Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, mkay?
No, they have to be able to get grades!
M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?
Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?
Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)
But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--
Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.
Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra.
Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. 
Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
And still tells the world that we don't. 
I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.
So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay? 
Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before.
Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?
Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay?  The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela , the school janitor. Okay?  He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face!  So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.
Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.  M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.  Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  M'kay...  You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.  Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on "school clinic" Mkay, see nurse. M'kay. Respiration problems.  Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.  It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.  Mesage... board.  Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,  here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski.  Okay, little Ike says "My brother is a homo" Ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?
M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who want to start?  M'kay, class.
Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?
Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?
M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?
It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?
Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. 
Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. 
Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
Okay, let's see, lights.  Mood.  Start counseling timer.  Okay there we go. Okay, we got it.  Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, "Attention Deficit Disorder," or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.
Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina."  Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.
Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it?  Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay.  Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.
Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
And that's exactly why you need to go!
Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment.  Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment.  Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay.  Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?
Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!
M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
No, Clinton's vice-president.  He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. 
Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?
Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins!
Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... "missed" anything.
But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay.
