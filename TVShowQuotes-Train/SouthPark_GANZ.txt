You're right. Quick, let's get out of here! 
Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.
Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! 
It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.
We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
You see it? You see it? Go get it.  Go get it!  Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!
Uh oh.  Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation.
We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.
Sh.  All is well. Do not shoot at 
Look out!  Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm.  People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender!
