Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
Yeah, take your time.
Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Can I see?
What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
How was the drive?
Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
[in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
I think everything is under control.
Seriously disgusting.
I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?

My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
Can you��� without running to the other side of the room all night?
Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.
[giggles]
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Okay, yeah.
You should sit down.
Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
Thank you-
Are you okay?
Stop it! [runs out the door]
LeBron James.
Is this really nessecary?
[coughs and moans]
It's almost too warm.
Well, that's how I played it in college.

Cool, for your kids?
