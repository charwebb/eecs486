The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?
I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
While people play in the sun all day
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
I told you, we can't go to my house!
Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
Let us not forget what happens this day!
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
When do you think uh it'll get here?
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
There you go. You're back on the track.
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
You can see the momma bird fly in.
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
Whre do we go? Where do we go?
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Well first, he went to see a movie.
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
But I gotta get back to my family.
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 
Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
But I just did what he told me!
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
I have to come right to my room after school.
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 
Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
No! That's just what I look like. See?
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
Well what the heck do we do now?
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
What about my parents. Did you see them?
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already!

Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
They have to show it! They promised they would!
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
Oh no, what did I do this time?
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
