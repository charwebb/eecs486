I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
They have to show it! They promised they would!
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Oh no, what did I do this time?
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
I told you, we can't go to my house!
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
But I just did what he told me!
W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
Well what the heck do we do now?
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
There you go. You're back on the track.
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
While people play in the sun all day
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
What about my parents. Did you see them?
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
No! That's just what I look like. See?
You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
But I gotta get back to my family.
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
Whre do we go? Where do we go?
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
Well first, he went to see a movie.
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
I have to come right to my room after school.
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
When do you think uh it'll get here?
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Let us not forget what happens this day!
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
