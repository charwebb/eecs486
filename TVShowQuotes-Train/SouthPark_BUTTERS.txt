Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.

Holy moly! 

Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!

Hold on, fellas!

P-please don't ice me, homie?

So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-

And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!

Awww.

How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?

Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 

That's me.

Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 

Oh, come on!

How?

Cool, thanks.

Not working out?

Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.

Hang on a second, here! 

Uhhh, yeah.

Woo, spooky.

Every single night.

Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.

What's up fellas?

That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  

Sorry. My arms hurt.

Ho, I don't wanna!

Hey, fellas!

AWESOM-O?!

Oh no, what did I do this time?

Yes.

Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! 

AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 

Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.

That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.

I understand. 

Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.

Oh. Hey Wendy.

Now you go, Baahir. 

Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.

It's a kissing company.

And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?

Yeah.

You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 

Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.

Let's do this!

What?! Oh no!

You didn't read them?

It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 

Heheh, yeah. 

Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.

Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.

Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.

Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head

Yeeah. Is it true?

I waited all night for you to get off work.

Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!

Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 

Lobster Boy?

Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!

Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.

You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?

Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 

It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 

Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.

Ow! Dad?

Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 

I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 

"What What (In The Butt)," sir.

No it doesn't.

Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!

Huh-Hallelujah!

Who, me?

Whoa! 

W-what party?

We can't tell you.

Eric? Iiis that you?

Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.

Hey ugly! 

That's me!

Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!

Really?

Ohhh, we lost?

Oh no.

Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?

This is faggot. Go ahead.

...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.

Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!

Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.

Rotten boobie turds!

I love you too, Dad. 

Herro, prease.

Let's do it!

I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.

Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.

Broke fence...

You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 

Oh, okay. 

Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!

You think Jewpacabra is here?

You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?

How come?

Oh, well, here he is.

Yep. I'm in jail.

No- but you don't sound like me.

Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.

Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?

I know.

Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?

Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.

Thanksgiving is about murder?

Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 

Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.

Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.

Aw, heck. 

My grandma??

Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?

Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!

I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!

Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.

Wow, you really know what you're doing.

I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.

No! That's just what I look like. See?

Eh, but then why did they come back to the past

Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!

You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?

Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.

That's Lisa Berger?

Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?

Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?

Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 

Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.

Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?

Me too!

We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!

AWESOM-O! 

Ow...

God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!

Hey, fellas.

Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.

The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?

No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!

We're going! 

So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 

Mom. Dad.

It does?

Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 

Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 

Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.

What?

Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 

Hey! Let's run naked through the street! 

Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.

Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.

Better prizes.

I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!

Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.

I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 

How far away is June?

I have no idea, sir.

I don't follow.

Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?

Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 

Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-

Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 

Ehyeah!

No, you took it all!

My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.

Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 

Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?

Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.

Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.

Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.

Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.

Waaahaa!

Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.

Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!

Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?

There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.

I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.

Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.

Yes!

My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 

Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.

I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.

Aaaah!

...Uh, who's Jack?

Hi, Grandma!

I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 

We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.

Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 

Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.

Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.

We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!

Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.

No!

Ahhh shit.

Comin' dad! 

Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.

But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!

Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 

...Yeah. 

Heheyehah.

Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.

He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!

Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.

General Disarray, are your parents home?

Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.

Woohoohoohoohoo!

Well I can certainly see why.

Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!

No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.

Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?

Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!

I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!

I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 

Interim status is go.

Because I'm bi-curious?

I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. 

What do you want?

Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.

Woo-oh Holy Cow! 

Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!

Aren't you coming?

Aaaa!! 

Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!

Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...

You will?

Huh?

Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!

Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.

Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 

GAA HAA!

Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?

Why?!

Okay Cartman!

Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.

Oh my God, let me see!

ARRRRRRGH!

Oh hey Eric.

Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??

Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!

We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.

O-kay!

I'm trying!

Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.

You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!

Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?

Oh neato, huh fellas?

Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.

My Grandma?

I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!

You died?? How??

Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.

Ohhhhh ohhhhh!

It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.

Eavesdropper?

Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.

That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.

Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.

That was fast.

Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 

Neato!

How are things... oing with your new best friend?

Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 

Are we out in the destruction?

Do you see any Indians?

I've never done this before. 

Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 

Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.

Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?

Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?

Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?

Oh uh, ho yeah.

There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..

It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.

We finally did it!

I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!

Ohhh, he's got her now!

Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.

Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 

We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.

Oh jeez...

Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.

Wow.

Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.

Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.

Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 

Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!

Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!

Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?

Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 

Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.

...What? What do you mean?

Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.

HA?!

Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.

All those ladies have stinky vaginas?

What do I do?!

"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."

Pardon me?

How?

It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!

Aaah! Nooo! 

Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?

Dwaah!!

Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.

Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.

I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.

Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!

If this doesn't work, we're dead.

Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 

I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please

One please.

Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 

Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. 

Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.

You seemed really stupid, Eric.

Oh hamburgers! What is that?? 

No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.

Yes!

The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 

Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 

No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 

Prostitute!

Really?

I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.

Hey Eric.

Boy, we sure did.

Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.

AGH! No! Please! You can't!

Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.

Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 

Uh, is this the Stotch residence?

Yeh, you didn't? 

Huh but I thought you were one!

Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 

Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.

Ms. Choksondik,

AH- 

Go Stan!

Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 

Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.

'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 

We already got a dollar!

He's bi-curious too?

Well actually, Eric, it's you. 

Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.

Huh s-s-super-AIDS?

Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.

No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!

Uhm, oh. 

You're givin' away all your money??

Uh, Mr. Garrison?

I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 

You sure you want to do this?

Oh, thanks.

No!

Wow wee, look at him go!

Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 

Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?

But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?

No! 

AAAAAHHH!

Wuh who are you talking about?

Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.

Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!

Hi Dad! 

Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!

Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 

...ow... Ow... It's not workin'

What?! Well since when?

Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?

Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?

But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 

They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!

No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 

Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?

Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 

Why are they gonna kill my parents?

Oh hamburgers.

Hooray!

I touched Wendy's boobs. 

Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 

Well okay! Let's do it!

Not me! I'm a squirrel!

Haaah! 

The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.

NO Wikileaks! Bad!

I'm sorry.

I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?

Well okay, I'm sorry!

Well, but ah I can get better.

Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'

For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...

We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!

Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.

Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.

Oh God, oh God!

Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.

How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.

Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?

But they-ah they're angry at me.

I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.

Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"

This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.

Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.

Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 

At Cartman's house.

Heh, h-hey fellas. 

But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-

Wow, Jared!

I'm hung like a horse!

Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 

Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 

Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 

Waaaaaah!

Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!

Y-yeah!

We're crossin' the border!

Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?

Whoopie! G and R Railroad!

Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?

Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 

Wuh-what's the matter?

Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.

By, by my, by myself?

Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.

Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?

Yeah, it sure has.

Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 

Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?

Hoh boy, oh boy! 

Well Eric did. 

Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!

Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.

Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.

But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.

Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.

Awww jeez, you're no fun. 

They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 

Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.

Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 

Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.

Well I thought it was pretty good.

...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.

Oh uh, nothin'.

Huwhoa! 

Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.

Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!

Sure.

Then do it, if you're not yellow! 

Yes?

Wow, the cops came?

Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.

Oh, not really sir, I just uh...

Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?

You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 

The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.

Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...

Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 

Huh, that was incredible!

Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.

You have to be careful with scissors.

Poop- poop swatches?

I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?

AAAAHH!

Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?

Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 

Yeah.

Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.

Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...

Oh, heh-hey dad.

The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.

This place is awesome!

My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!

Hey fellas!

Lu lu lu, lu lu lu 

You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?

But why?

Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 

The who?

Red Lobster!

Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?

I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.

Oh I'm sorry, mom.

A gun?

Hah?

Oh. Hey fellas.

Yes ma'am. 

Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?

I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 

Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.

Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!

No way!

Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.

Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.

U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.

I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!

But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.

Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 

Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!

Well, uh I sure am, I guess.

Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.

Nuh uh!

Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 

We got it. We got it!

I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!

Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 

Hi Dad.

All week long, bossman say

Sure I do!

So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.

Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.

Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!

Cheese!

Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 

Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 

I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!

Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!

Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.

I wonder how long I'm grounded for?

But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.

Murder porn?

Pass this up.

Stop breathin'?

Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!

The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!

Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."

Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.

O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.

Oh no. Which book was that?

Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.

Oh, hi Eric.

Yeah. He's a badass! 

Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"

Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.

Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 

Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!

I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?

Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.

Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?

Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.

Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.

We're gonna get it now!

Oh, no. Oh, geez!

Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.

Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?

Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?

He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 

Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!

...Die??

Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!

NO I I'm not a scab.

Huh-I'm in for five!

Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!

Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.

Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?

Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.

Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!

Huh?

Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.

Well yeah, I s'psoe

But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!

Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!

Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!

Oh hamburgers!

It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!

Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?

Yeah.

Well sure I do.

I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?

Dad?  Dad, you in here?

Okay.  Ow. Ooww!

Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.

Pirates ho! 

I'm bi-curious.

I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 

Well that sounds good.

Oh Jeez...

Well, sure I can!

Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!

Hey, fellas!

How do you know?

Eric! Don't ever talk like that!

Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 

Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!

Wha? Awww.

Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!

Stupid news hair! 

...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.

What?

Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 

AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.

Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?

Well sure.

Really?

Mmuh well, not really, no.

Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?

Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.

I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.

Yeah.

Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 

It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!

He's a peckerface, that's what he is!

Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.

How come uh, I can't see?

I love you too, ladies. 

I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.

Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.

I ain't grounded, am I?

Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.

Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.

What's that?  Awww! 

But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?

Yes, they will.

Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!

I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!

What?

She's speechless!

You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.

I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!

Yeah!

Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!

Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 

You... you're my robot?

Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?

Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 

Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 

Hi Aunt Nellie! 

What's the game?

I don't want my parents to die.

Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- 

The government watches everything we do?

Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.

Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.

Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.

AAAAH!

Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!

Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!

I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.

Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!

Hey fellas!

He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.

Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.

Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 

Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.

We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 

Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 

Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.

He can't! Don't you understand?!

Oh, it's all sticky. 

Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.

I am?

Uh yeah, ah I think so.

Oh Jesus! Wait.

Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.

Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.

Yes, it's me.

Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?

Huh?

Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 

...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.

When?

Meheecan, it's your

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

That's right, Jimmy.

Biggest story about who?

People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!

Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!

Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.

Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-

What is that?

Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.

Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. 

Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.

Oh hamburgers! 

Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?

Yeah,  fuck 'em.

So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?

Hey fellas.

A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.

Well what the heck do we do now?

Hi, Mom and Dad!

Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?

Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.

Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah! 

Oh. Yeah.

Ehthat was pretty good.

Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 

Probably watching Becker.

Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?

You can see the momma bird fly in.

...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!

So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?

This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!

That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!

Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 

Yes.

AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.

Uh, that's me!

You... you and your cousin touched wieners?

Wow, that's gonna be so fun!

It's gonna be okay, Eric.

Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.

Just hold it. That's what I do now. 

Then we gotta work on your campaign.

Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?

Uhyep.

I'm not playing. I really don't know!

Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!

Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.

What about my parents. Did you see them?

I know what you're saying.

Haaaah.

Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 

Okay, thanks. 

Hey Eric!

Yeah.

Busted!

Ah how do you know that?!

Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.

Theh theh, there she is. 

Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!

Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?

Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 

Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.

They're gonna do it!

Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 

There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.

Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 

I'm getting a surprise! 

Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?

Okay, but... what are you going to do?

Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?

I'm sorry!

Hah! 

Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 

I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.

Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.

Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 

You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!

Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!

Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.

No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 

Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.

She chickened out!

They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!

I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.

How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?

I'll miss you too, ghost pal.

Me?!

Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?

Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.

Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 

Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 

Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!

How do I do that?

Yeah!

Oh Jeez!

I'm back, Ma!

I got World of Warcraft, like you said.

Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.

No! No! Noooooo!

What the heck are you doing?!

Well I like you too, Bradley.

They don't!

Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.

Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 

That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.

You're not a cannibal, are you?

Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.

Wuh well, sure. 

Oh Jesus! 

Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.

Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.

Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.

Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 

We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!

To the gym.

Whoa...

No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!

Mmmwhoa boy!

Waa... ahaaah... 

Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 

Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?

Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!

But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.

I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 

Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!

Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!

Hurry. Go, go! 

Uh, I won't tell anybody.

You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.

I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-

Uh, that's me!

...ow... Ow!

Huh?

Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?

Whaaat??

And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 

Sing your Song, earn your pay

Waaaa! 

Yeah, I'm broooding.

Hello? Eh-anybody in here?

Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.

Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?

Whoa, look at it!

Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.

Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!

Who's coming this way?

And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 

WHY?!

Obama's fuckin' gay.

Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 

Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.

I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!

Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! 

Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."

Well, there's only like four races to choose from-

Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 

Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 

Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.

This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.

Four times, mom.

Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.

I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.

But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.

Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-

Aw nuts!

Me neither. 

It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?

Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 

Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 

A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?

Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!

Whoa, hey Eric.

Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 

Sir, I'm confused.

Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!

Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.

Kill your mom?

U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.

What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!

No, Eric. I don't wanna d-

Triceratops!

No, Eric! 

Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.

You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?

It's not?!

Wuh be careful, Kyle.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 

A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!

Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 

Yeah, ahh, that's right!

Eric! Erihic!

Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!

Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 

Okay.

There's vampires in the school!

Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.

Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?

We could have our very own...  kissin' company.

I don't know what you mean.

Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?

"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.

...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.

Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?

Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.

Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?

But he's dying! 

Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.

That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"

Meheecan

Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-

Thanks, Dad.

Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.

"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."

Oh gosh!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Huh?

Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.

Huh, invasion pran.

Well what do we do now?

Oh, Jesus, see me through this.

Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.

It's megasuperhilarious! 

Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.

No, you're good. 

Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.

Well, like what?

Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.

Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 

Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! 

Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.

They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!

Happy Deadline Day!

Hear hear.

Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 

Santa. Saaanta.

What's "port"?!

What?

Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.

Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?

Well, not a hundred percent...

So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 

Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.

Woof woof.

Oh... 

It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.

But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 

Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!

Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.

Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.

Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 

Have a good day! 

Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.

Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.

My wiener is all stiff and pointy!

It's all quiet out front, Eric.

Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.

So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!

That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.

Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 

Hey Stan, I have a note for you.

AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 

Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!

Hey Lexus.

Lexus! 

Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!

Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?

How much further to Castle Sunshine?

All right! Cartman's president. We did it.

Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-

...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.

What are you whoofelin' at? 

Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.

See ya, Lisa! 

Ah, all right then.

At Red Robster. 

Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.

Well, sure thing, Dad.

I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 

Ha-a how come I gotta go first?

Uh, well, to solve mysteries.

Wu-what sound?

Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?

Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 

Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.

Viva la Meheeco!

Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?

Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.

That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!

Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?

Pissin' me off!

Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?

But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-

"White Swallow Bath House"

Well done!

Oh, sweet Jesus.

Well yeah, but... we usually win.

Well, she sure is.

I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!

Got it. 

Oh, okay! 

My name's Butters.

He says, he love you. 

Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.

Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?

Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.

Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!

AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?

Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?

Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.

Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?

Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.

Bwaagghh! 

I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 

Yeah, I guess.

Yeah!

Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 

Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.

Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.

Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.

Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!

It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!

Oh God, oh my God no! 

Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!

Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!

Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.

You mean it?

Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'

Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.

Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?

No! No! 

More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!

Well, count me out.

Yeah, me too.

My grandma is from Virginia. 

Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.

Well yeah!

What was that?

Yeah, I finished it!

Whoa.

Hey Eric! 

How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 

Oh my God, the police are looking for us!

Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 

So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!

Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 

Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.

Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.

Mom, Dad!  I changed back!

Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .

I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!

One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.

PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-

Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-

Stay calm, Eric.

Make that two! 

Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?

Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.

Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?

There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.

Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!

Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 

Happy Anniversary!

I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!

Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.

I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.

Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.

I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 

What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!

Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!

Oh boy, here it comes!

Huh uh.

Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 

Uh, hey Dad.

Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.

Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?

She's coming! She's coming!

Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.

Hey look, somebody lost their pet.

Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.

You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.

Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.

Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.

Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.

Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 

I do. 

Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!

Oh God, I'm scared.

Get out of my room, Stan.

Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.

Jesus is a lie?

Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.

Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.

Let me have the tape!

Sir? Hello?

...No.

I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.

Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?

Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.

Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 

Me! I saw a ghost!

Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?

No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 

YES.

Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.

Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 

Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!

Oh, all right then.

Noooo!

Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.

Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.

I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?

Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!

Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.

Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?

Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.

Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.

Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!

Oh hamburgers! 

Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?

What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 

Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?

Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?

But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?

It hurts! It hurts! 

Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.

But...  but you're here right now. 

Uhh rrreeally are you sure?

Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 

Uh hello, I'm Butters.

You killed her! 

Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.

I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 

Oh no!

No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.

Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??

Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!

...Pretty good.

Wow!

This is for all the times I got grounded! 

And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!

Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-

What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?

Wuh it's me, Butters.

Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.

Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.

Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!

I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?

...Ohhh!

Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?

Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 

No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.

Eh yeah I do too!

Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!

Huh?

Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 

Huuh what's the matter?

Sure. 

Cartman?

Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 

Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.

I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.

Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.

What??

Huh. Huh, uh, uh.

Huh... 

I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-

So I won't see you again?

Okay! 

Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!

NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-

Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 

Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!

Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!

I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!

I don't play World of Warcraft.

Well, what are we waitin' for?!

What's... bi-curious?

Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 

Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!

Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!

Okay, I'm back in your room!

Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.

Whoa!

But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.

I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 

I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it

Will do.

What's a PewDiePie do?

Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!

Man...

Oh. He-he says they're in there. 

I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 

Vampires. I've seen them.

Stupider than Bebe!

Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.

This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.

Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."

Wahh!

Whoops. 

How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?

Eric, are you sure you can do this?

Well first, he went to see a movie.

But I can't see nothin'.

But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.

Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!

Well at least there's that.

Really?

More of the school. 

Uh oh.

Uugh!

It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!

Wuh, that's my face, sir.

Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.

Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 

I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 

No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!

Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.

Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.

Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 

I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-

Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?

Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?

Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?

Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!

Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?

Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.

Yes...

Where is Mr. Hat, sir?

He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!

Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 

Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.

So that's it? We're broken up now?

It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.

He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 

Well, uh, see ya, fellas. 

...No.

Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 

It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.

Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?

Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!

Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.

Whoa.  Neat-o.  Well, this is good.

Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.

Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.

Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.

Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.

Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...

No, I'm sick of it!

How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.

Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.

Uh what condition?

Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.

Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?

A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 

This is gonna be great!

The union? Oh, that's why you came?

Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.

What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?

We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 

Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.

Uhbu-but I'm from here.

Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.

All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...

Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.

But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?

Oh jeez!

Well okay!

Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. 

Um, excuse me?

Huh?

WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.

I'm gonna fall! 

My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 

OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!

Well. Alright, then. 

Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 

Like me!

Not again.

Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?

That's me!

Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.

Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!

Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.

Here we are, Mom and Dad! 

Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?

We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.

Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.

I'm here, Eric.

Aw, poor girl.

Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!

Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.

I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!

Lie?

Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!

Uhh alright then. 

Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.

Is that really all our wiener sizes?

What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.

Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?

Heeheeheeyeah.

That's me!

Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!

Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 

Good night, fellas!

Now wees hases it! 

Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! 

AAAAHH! 

Oh, that'd be awesome! 

Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-

I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!

Um, does Kenny like her?

What's a pedophile?

Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!

Sellin' kisses?

"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??

Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.

Me, too!

Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.

Let me see!

Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.

Are we gonna get tested on this?

Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.

They sure do.

Oh hamburgers!! 

Yeah. You're right. 

Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.

Dad's a good shopper all right.

Are you being serious?

Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.

HAAAAA! 

Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 

Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.

Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.

I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.

The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 

I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!

What's that, Dad?

Yes, it's all very confusing!

Oh no!

No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!

HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 

Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.

Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.

Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?

Aww, that's okay, Eric.

Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 

Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?

How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?

Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!

Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 

I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now

Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.

Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.

Heh hey guys, what would I do?

Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!

Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.

He's right, lads. To adventure!

Uhhh a few hundred thousand?

Hi, Dad.

I tried to make a good picture. Honest.

No!

Yes sir! 

You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 

Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!

My, my picture?

Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 

What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 

Awww, that's okay, Bradley.

And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.

Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?

Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!

Hoh.

They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.

Huh, where are we goin'?

...No.

Well all right! 

Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.

But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.

Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.

A note?

When do you wanna see me?

AAAAAAHHH! 

Hello? 

Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?

Cheese!

Well, then... then let me go with you.

Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.

Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.

Been a hoot all right!

He's made in Japan!

Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.

Uh, sure.

Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.

Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!

It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 

Hey look! 

That you hate Smurfs?

Waaaaah!

Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 

What? What happened? 

Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"

What?

There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!

I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!

Look! The Mexican border!

Holy Moly.

I don't know what to do!

Yeah! 

What??

Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.

Jeeeeezz!

Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.

Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!

Lemmiwinks? NO!

And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."

Hey Jimmy.

I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.

Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-

Well, hooray!

Aw hamburgers. 

Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.

Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.

Whoa! Hey Dad! 

Huh?

Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.

What?

Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 

Now you know my terrible secret!

Well yeah, sure.

I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!

HAAAAH! 

And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!

Bill Clinton.

Skeletor's a lady??

Nnn-how terrible?

Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.

That was a very informative speech, Kyle.

Huh, me neither.

You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...

Hmmm, it's kind of gay.

Wait. Now I am confused.

Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!

All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 

Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.

Aw, we're still grounded?

Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?

Huh?

NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!

Yeah?

Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?

You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??

No, uh Craig's here, too.

OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.

Waaaah! 

Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?

Oh, that's okay. I think...

Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 

Yeah.

Are you sure?

Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.

Well, that's your problem!

I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.

Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.

Ahhh well oh- kay.

Uh hey Eric!

Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 

Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.

Haah! Leave me alone! 

Slash is make-believe??

Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!

Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.

Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?

Oh yeah? 

They sure don't.

Whoa... 

Uhh,  mahjey burazi?

Oh.

Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.

I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.

Oh no, my Dad?

AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! 

One dollar pledge!

Yeah!

When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.

Come on, Kyle!

He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 

Whoa!

AAAAH! 

Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 

And our parents hollered at us!

But this is what I keep seeing in my head!

Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.

What's a urinal?

That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!

Guess!

Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.

Hey Dad. 

Uh ohhh.

You think I'm ugly-ehehee...

Huuuhhhh, no.

AAAAH!  I'll get over! 

Ah, sí señor.

How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!

Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?

Okay. 

Hallelujah!

Huh, who, you mean you?

Nuh uh!

Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.

Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.

Oh well, we're busted. 

Can I go now?

N-no reason! 

So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?

I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-

Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.

Like what?

When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.

Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.

When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!

Almost time. 

Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.

Haaa!

Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.

Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!

Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!

Ah, I can do it again.

My mom?  Hello?

What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.

Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.

Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.

I'll throw in a dollar!

It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.

Yes, sir. 

Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!

Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-

Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.

Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?

Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!

I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.

Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?

Hi! Is Lexus here?

I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 

Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 

Oh jeez! 

Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.

Thank you! 

Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 

That way it won't matter if you get detention.

Whoa!

Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!

Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!

I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.

Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!

Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 

I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?

Whoa boy! Camp!

Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.

Surrender?! No, the heck with that!

What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.

Hey, do you guys smell that?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!

Oh no! Kenny!

I have to come right to my room after school.

Shouldn't we get him back in the water?

Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?

Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.

bu- but fellas, I gotta- 

Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.

Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!

Go away! You aren't real!

Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.

Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?

But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...

Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.

Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 

Am I just an asshole?

Do you feel warm and compassionate?

Yes sir.

How bad is it, doctor?

12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.

Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?

Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.

Yeah! ...What's this for? 

Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!

Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?

Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!

It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!

Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.

Robbed us of our innocence... 

He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!

Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 

Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.

Oh they, they do, huh?

Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?

Yeah!

You mean like Jared?

I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.

Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!

Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.

Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 

Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!

Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 

Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!

Leave me alone!

Base! 

We know. It's preposterous.

Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.

Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.

Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.

Ooohhhh!

Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.

Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? 

All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!

No.

Really?

Nobody asked.

Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.

Okay, okay.

Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!

You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?

Whatoyou mean?

Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?

Be careful! The powerlines!

You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?

Hahaha, a turd sandwich!

Yeah?

It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.

That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!

Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.

Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 

Uh- go where?

Me, Butters.

Great benefit, Eric!

You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 

Oh...

Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.

Yeah!

Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?

Hey, where are you going?

Woo. We aren't havin' a party.

Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...

I wrote that. 

You're perfectly normal, Bradley.

But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?

Red Lobster!

Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!

Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!

Aw man.

NOOooo!

42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 

All right! 

No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!

W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!

The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!

Oh. O-oh, okay.

Oh God. I missed you so much.

You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!

Okay.

Hey, Eric.

Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.

Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 

Game on!

So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!

Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.

You don't know how hard it is to be me. 

Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.

Sure.

Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 

U-huh.  Ow.

Boy, that was a great episode!

Yes! Yes, anything else?

Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!

Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.

...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?

Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 

Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 

Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.

Eric! Uh what are you doing here?

Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.

Oh... Thank you. 

Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!

Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?

Wait! W-why does it have to be me??

Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.

Oh.  Alright, then. I-

But I just did what he told me!

It's, it's... I just had it! 

You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?

Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 

Huh I'm sorry Dad!

O-kay!

Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.

Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh

Oh, hamburgers.

What?! You said nobody would know!

Let him have it, Stan!

Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 

Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.

No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.

Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 

Yup!

Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.

Fing fong ting tong.

What's sarcasm and what's com?

Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 

Well it's not where I aimed, honest.

Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!

Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?

Well yeah.

Yeah!

Red Lobster!

All right, Eric, come on, Eric.

Wow.

Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.

You're a liar!

Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.

Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!

I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?

I feel Stan! He looks totally real!

No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!

Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!

Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.

Oh, now we're gonna get it.

Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.

HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.

Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!

I don't want a gun, Eric!

Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.

Uhh, okay. 

I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.

Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 

Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?

But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-

Two years ago. Two years ago!

Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.

Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.

Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-

Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-

Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.

Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?

Oh jumping Jesus! 

No. I like bein' bi-curious.

Huh, I'm over here, Dad.

I am.

Gaaaah!

Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.

Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.

Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?

Uh, not exactly.

No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!

Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez

Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.

Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.

There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!

I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.

Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.

I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 

Suppornity window dropped. 

Hang on, Lemmiwinks!

Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?

Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 

Bleh, ogayedmi.

Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.

Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.

Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 

You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?

Wuh sure, Eric. 

Woof woof. 

Well, gay is wholesome.

Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!

Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?

Fuck him up, Wendy!

No! 

Aw, I feel silly.

So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.

Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.

Uh, how come?

Sick!

I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!

All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.

Oh...

Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 

Oh. Yes?

But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 

Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!

Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."

I told you, we can't go to my house!

I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!

Huh.

Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.

Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!

Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 

I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.

Oh gosh in heaven.

Get out of here, all of ya! 

Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?

He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?

Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 

Wow! A present just for me? 

Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now

Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.

Wuh, what can I do?

But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.

You said I'm ugly and flat.

You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.

Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now

The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.

We aren't makin' that much, fellas.

They have to show it! They promised they would!

Little white lies?

I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.

Hey fellas. What's happenin'?

I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!

Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.

Skeletor is real??

Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-

In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.

While people play in the sun all day

He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.

Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?

Already? Oh no!

Yeah. 

Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 

Lie about celebrities.

Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.

Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 

But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.

Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.

But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 

Huh??

Whoa!

Huh? Why?

First, just let Butters sseee the precious.

Sorry! 

Huh?

Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.

No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!

Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?

I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 

Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!

Oh God! I hate cannibals!

Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 

Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 

Ah, shucks! 

Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.

I just see stars. 

Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?

Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 

Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!

W-we are.

Woahhh!

Let us not forget what happens this day!

Kenny!

Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 

Did you ever do anything really bad?

Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.

Stupid Simpsons...

Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!

It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 

Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.

Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?

Huh?

When do you think uh it'll get here?

Whoopie! 

II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.

Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 

It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.

What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!

Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down there? 

So where's the part where we have a good time?

All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 

Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 

What circuit?

But I don't want to see you!

I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.

AAAAAAHAHAH! 

We're busted! Uh what do we do??

Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!

What what what?

Wha-what do you want me to do?

Take that, you dumb hooker!

That's nice. 

Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 

Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?

I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??

Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?

Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 

Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?

That's me.

Stop it!

Well, I'm scared. 

Uh what's the Barrier?

From Eric.

Aaah. 

Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!

Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.

Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.

Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.

Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! 

Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?

Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.

Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?

Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.

Hey! Ours is still alive!

Huh?

Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.

Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.

That's me!

Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!

See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-

Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?

Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?

Hang on now.

All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!

Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.

Uh- perfect.

Fellas! Where'd you come from? 

Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.

Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.

Oh hey Dad.

Waaaahh!

Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 

He told me to!

Yeah! Dumb girls!

Oh, all right, then. 

O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!

The Geniuses...

You mean, like a goldfish?

Huh?

Oh boy!

Well I just... used my imagination.

NO!

A midget?

There you go. You're back on the track.

Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.

Waah! 

Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?

Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.

Okay, subject is ready.

Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-

Eric?

Ohhh hamburgers! 

This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!

H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 

We can?

Oh sorry, sorry. 

Naw, I'm lyin'

Cool!

Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?

What? Why would I do that?

Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!

Yippie!

Well he is.

We're not fans!

Darling!

Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.

Okay. 

Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!

Uh, yeah?

Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?

Fuck you, Eric. 

Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!

Officer, can I stay in jail, please?

They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-

We lost?

Well, no, not quite.

Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 

Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!

Wow.

Ha-I'll be nine next week.

Another two dollars!

What?

That's fuckin' gay as hell.

Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 

Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.

Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 

Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.

WHAT?? 

Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!

You just got me busted forever!

What powers? Ah I don't understand.

And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.

Another week?  I hate my stupid face.

Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.

I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 

Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-

Hello, heh.

Uhuh, Eric.

Everything's getting dark...

Olé!

That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 

Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!

Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.

Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.

But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.

Okay, I got it!

Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.

Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.

Huh?

Giddy up! 

This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.

Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.

Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.

I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.

Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! 

Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.

I'm trying, sir! 

Oh I know.

Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 

Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 

Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.

Whoopie! 

Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!

Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.

It's true!

I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.

How come?

Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.

Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!

Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.

You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.

The Chinese?

Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 

Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!

Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.

I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.

Hey yeah, all the time.

Oh, Stan!

Congratulations, Kyle.

How about we read each other's future?

No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!

...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!

Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!

Hehyeah?

I'm sure! There's no way!

It evaporates.

Wow.

Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.

And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 

Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?

I sure am, Dad!

I sure hope this works.

We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!

Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.

Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!

Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 

Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??

Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 

Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.

Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.

Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 

You can do it, Kyle!

Well alright then.

Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.

No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.

Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.

Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 

They're gonna do it! 

No ma'am.

Really?

Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 

But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.

Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!

Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.

Oh no!

Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!

Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.

Huh-it sure was.

Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 

Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 

Hey, I was about to win!

Huh... Oh, it's terrible.

He had sins that he didn't confess!

Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.

Oh sweet Jesus!

Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?

Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.

Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.

...Okay.

The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!

Yes! Yehhehehes!

Aww. Dangit. 

No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 

Yeah. 

Before what happens? 

Uh, hey, fellas.

Yeah.

Go where?

Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.

Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!

I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.

I donno.

Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?

'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.

What?? 

Yes, sir. 

So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?

Ahhh, huh?

Okay. I'm not lookin'. 

Huhuh, look at all this stuff.

Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?

Oh, boy!

Oh God! Oh Jesus! 

Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.

I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!

Going now! 

Ye-!  wait, what?

WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 

Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 

On my girlfriend.

Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 

Of course not!

He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!

That's me!

And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.

Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?

I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 

Oh wow!

Well, we're here, now what do I do? 

Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 

Well... hah... HWAAAH! 

Does this mean... you have to go now?

Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.

Oh really?

Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!

I think you gotta press the gas pedal.

Ahah-oo well, alright then. 

N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.

But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!

What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 

We're from Hawaii?

Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!

Hey, fellas! 

I love you too, Dad.

Yeah Kyle?

Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!

Hey guys!

Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?

Eric, stop it!

Hey. Where'd Eric go?

Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!

Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 

Ho! Daywalkers!

Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.

I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.

She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!

Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!

I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-

Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 

Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!

Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.

We-ell hold on a second, you guys.

Do you need to wash your hands?

Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 

Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!

Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?

Wuhuff, woof, woof.

Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.

Sure, I love the Truth.

Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.

Well, sure I can see you.

Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?

Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.

Hokay. 

Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.

Well, I'm workin' on it.

Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.

I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.

Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!

He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!

Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 

Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!

Hello?

You mean it's like, like a monster?

Whoa.

I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!

Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?

You folks are all native Hawaiians too?

AWESOM-O?

Eh, just about.

A surprise? What is it?

Compassionate.

Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.

The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?

Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?

My dad said it's not for spying on people.

That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.

AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 

Wow! That was cool!

Neato!

Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 

Oh, she said it again!

Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.

Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!

Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!

Aww, this one again?!

Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!

Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 

Yeh you're still here.

Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!

Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!

Whoa, it's like gasoline!

I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.

Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.

Oh uh, hi Mom.

But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.

Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 

They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!

Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.

She's pretty!

Join me?

Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!

Oh jeez. 

Can I go now?

Me neither.

Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.

Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 

Ruh, really?

Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?

But I gotta get back to my family.

Hey Dad!

I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 

Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.

Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 

Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.

Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 

Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?

Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.

Well but, but what happened?

What's Raisins?

I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 

Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 

Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.

DAD! Hey Dad!

In...in who, Eric?

A well-organized pantry.

It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.

Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.

The Butters knowses.

Hey, robots don't fart!

Mrs. Cartman?

Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.

Dangit, I wish I knew people.

Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.

No more... arts and crafts...

Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.

Hey Eric.

Okey doke.

Uh here comes an SUV. 

I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!

I seriously didn't mean it.

Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 

REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.

You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!

Okay. 

Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 

Yeah...I guess it is...

What's "saimin"?

You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?

Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.

Haaaah!

Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.

There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 

Stan and Kyle are really good at it.

Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.

I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!

Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.

Hey! Here they come! 

Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!

I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.

Aaaaah!

Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.

Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.

What's that?

Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.

They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.

Double wow! 

Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.

That's me!

Who's George R. R. Martin?

What??

But, you told me I did!

Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 

Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 

Man this sucks!

AAaaghagh!

Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 

Wull what is it?

Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?

AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!

That looks dangerous.

Really? Do you think that's best?

Come on, Stan! 

Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.

No.

Precious! 

Uh what do you mean?

Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.

Uhwhat?

Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?

I think someone's in there.

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians

Me too.

Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.

Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.

Come on! What are you guys goin' as?

Oh. Double hamburgers.

What kind do we want?!

Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.

Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!

Ww-ww-what's the N S A?

Oh boy!

AAAH!

Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!

We came over to cheer you up, Stan!

Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 

Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!

Wow! Neato!

Are you sure?

I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.

Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 

Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.

Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.

Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-

Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?

Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.

Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.

Aw thanks.

Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.

Haba, haba! Habahoaha! 

Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?

Kyle did that? Gee whiz.

He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.

Uh what's the matter, Scott?

Thank you! 

He's diabetic.

Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.

I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.

Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.

Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 

They're putting an end to it! 

This is, General Disarray. My final solution. 

Wwuhuh-o-kay! 

Uh what are we gonna do, huh?

Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?

Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?

I do love water balloons. 

I love our class!

Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! 

Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!

Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.

Wait! Waaait! 

Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.

Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!

A conspiracy?

Well sure, I guess.

Uh hey, wait a minute! 

Aw, I did it again?

Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.

Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?

Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?

I don't wanna get killed by boobs.

Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.

Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money

You bet!

Ew, they're all dirty.
