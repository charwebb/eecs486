No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
What about my parents. Did you see them?
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
Well first, he went to see a movie.
I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
They have to show it! They promised they would!
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
There you go. You're back on the track.
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
But I just did what he told me!
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
Well what the heck do we do now?
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
No! That's just what I look like. See?
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
I told you, we can't go to my house!
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
While people play in the sun all day
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
But I gotta get back to my family.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
When do you think uh it'll get here?
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
Whre do we go? Where do we go?
Does this mean... you have to go now?
H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
I have to come right to my room after school.
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
Let us not forget what happens this day!
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
You can see the momma bird fly in.
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?

Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.

We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!

It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late

I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus!
