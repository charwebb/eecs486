Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
No! That's just what I look like. See?
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
They have to show it! They promised they would!
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
I told you, we can't go to my house!
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
There you go. You're back on the track.
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
Well first, he went to see a movie.
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
Oh no, what did I do this time?
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
Well what the heck do we do now?
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
I have to come right to my room after school.
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
Let us not forget what happens this day!
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.

But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
While people play in the sun all day
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
Whre do we go? Where do we go?
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
What about my parents. Did you see them?
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
When do you think uh it'll get here?
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time.
