What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
Let us not forget what happens this day!
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
But I just did what he told me!
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
You can see the momma bird fly in.
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
I have to come right to my room after school.
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Well what the heck do we do now?
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
But I gotta get back to my family.
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!

Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?

We could have our very own...  kissin' company.

Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan?

Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!"

Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
No! That's just what I look like. See?
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
Well first, he went to see a movie.
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
They have to show it! They promised they would!
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
While people play in the sun all day
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
I told you, we can't go to my house!
There you go. You're back on the track.
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
What about my parents. Did you see them?
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
