Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!

Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?

Hello, heh.

No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 

Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.

Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.

Okay Cartman!

Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.

Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.

Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!

Cool!

What was that?

Wuh be careful, Kyle.

Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!

AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?

Pissin' me off!

Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.

Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?

Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.

Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...

Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!

Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?

Pirates ho! 

Huh, who, you mean you?

Neato!

Well, but ah I can get better.

And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 

Mom, Dad!  I changed back!

Nuh uh!

Wuh comin', Dad! 

Uh what are we gonna do, huh?

All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 

Wait. Now I am confused.

My wiener is all stiff and pointy!

What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 

An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.

My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.

Ww-ww-what's the N S A?

Hurry. Go, go! 

I don't wanna get killed by boobs.

But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 

Do you feel warm and compassionate?

What? Uh where are you going, Eric?

Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!

Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 

Whaaat??

Oh, hamburgers.

Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.

There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 

NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!

Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.

That's right, Jimmy.

Aww, this one again?!

I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.

Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"

Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.

You... you're my robot?

I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!

Hello?

Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez

... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?

Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 

Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.

Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.

Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.

Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .

Huh I'm sorry Dad!

Yeah!

Wow.

Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.

Uhh, okay. 

Well I like you too, Bradley.

...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.

It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!

I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.

Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. 

Yeah. 

Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?

Uhuh, Eric.

Oh uh, nothin'.

It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.

Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!

Hooray!

Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.

Yippie!

Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.

Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!

Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.

I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late

Let me get it now

Well I thought it was pretty good.

AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! 

You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 

Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.

Uh what do you mean?

I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 

Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! 

"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??

Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 

Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.

Oh Jeez. 

I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.

Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.

Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.

Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.

Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?

Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 

Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.

Yep. I'm in jail.

Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.

No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.

I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 

No more... arts and crafts...

They sure do.

Well, I'm workin' on it.

What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 

Uh but I spent it all.

Sure. 

Hi Dad.

Huh?

Hi! Is Lexus here?

Yes...

WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 

In...in who, Eric?

Hey. Where'd Eric go?

Fuck you, Eric. 

Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.

Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 

Me neither.

Well yeah, sure.

Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?

I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 

How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.

Four times, mom.

Oh, all right then. 

Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.

And our parents hollered at us!

Wow, neato! An album cover! 

YES.

Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!

Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?

Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.

Well, that's your problem!

Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?

Like what?

I think you gotta press the gas pedal.

Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!

Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 

Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!

Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.

Oh, not really sir, I just uh...

Oh jeez! 

Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!

Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.

Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 

Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.

Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 

You can do it, Kyle!

Go Stan!

Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!

I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!

Get out of my room, Stan.

Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!

I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.

AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 

Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.

What's a pedophile?

Ha-ey fellas. 

Yeah! ...What's this for? 

NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-

Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 

It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 

Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?

Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!

Ah, I can do it again.

Cheese!

Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.

Heeheeheeyeah.

Oh boy, here it comes!

Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.

Yeah, ahh, that's right!

Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'

I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!

Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"

Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.

Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!

He can't! Don't you understand?!

Oh my God, the police are looking for us!

Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.

It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.

Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?

Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.

But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...

Waa... ahaaah... 

Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.

Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.

You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.

I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.

Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 

Me, too!

Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!

U-huh.  Ow.

Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!

Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 

Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.

I wrote that. 

Now you go, Baahir. 

Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.

No ma'am.

Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?

Skeletor's a lady??

Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 

Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.

Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?

Wow, the cops came?

Thanks. 

Woo, spooky.

Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.

I c-I can?

Um, does Kenny like her?

On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! 

Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...

Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.

Mmmwhoa boy!

Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.

Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."

I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-

I have to come right to my room after school.

Sorry. My arms hurt.

Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 

Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.

Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!

What??

Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?

Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 

I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-

Did you ever do anything really bad?

The Butters knowses.

Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?

Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?

They sure don't.

Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!

Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? 

Eric! Erihic!

Yes?

Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!

They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.

Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!

Waaaah! 

Yeah.

Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 

Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.

Ah how do you know that?!

Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.

And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!

Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!

But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!

Hey Jimmy.

Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!

Hoh boy, oh boy! 

Probably watching Becker.

Take that, you dumb hooker!

Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!

All those ladies have stinky vaginas?

Me! I saw a ghost!

Son of a biscuit!

But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.

Here we are, Mom and Dad! 

Hey, fellas!

What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.

No!

It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 

Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 

We're busted! Uh what do we do??

Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head

Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 

Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.

Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.

We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!

Ohhhhh ohhhhh!

What?

Wuh sure, Eric. 

It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?

Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!

Leave me alone!

...No.

Ho! Daywalkers!

So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.

Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.

Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.

I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.

Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 

There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.

Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.

So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.

A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?

Heh hey guys, what would I do?

Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?

Congratulations, Kyle.

Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! 

Wait! Waaait! 

I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 

At Cartman's house.

What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 

The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?

Okay!!

They don't!

Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.

Yes, sir. 

Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?

I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!

AAAAAAHAHAH! 

Why?!

Ha-I'll be nine next week.

This is faggot. Go ahead.

She's speechless!

Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.

Fuck him up, Wendy!

Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!

I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.

Yeah.

Officer, can I stay in jail, please?

Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.

Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.

Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-

Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?

Oh, come on!

No! No! 

Stay calm, Eric.

We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!

I'm not playing. I really don't know!

Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 

Uhm, oh. 

'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 

Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?

My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 

Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.

Sing your Song, earn your pay

The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 

...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?

Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.

This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.

But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.

What powers? Ah I don't understand.

Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.

Uh hello, I'm Butters.

Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!

No! 

Uh, yeah?

Compassionate.

...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!

Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.

Heh, h-hey fellas. 

Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 

You're givin' away all your money??

For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...

Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 

Hahaha, a turd sandwich!

Oh gosh in heaven.

Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.

And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 

No!

He's made in Japan!

We took all kinds of video with his drone.

Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.

Oh hamburgers!

Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 

N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.

Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.

Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?

He had sins that he didn't confess!

But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.

Yes, sir. 

I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?

Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.

Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 

Hey, Eric.

Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?

You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?

Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.

Oh. O-oh, okay.

Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 

Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.

It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.

Oh jumping Jesus! 

But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?

Jeeeeezz!

Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.

Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- 

I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 

AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 

Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.

So I won't see you again?

Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 

You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!

Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.

You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...

Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 

Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.

I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-

Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.

Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!

He says, he love you. 

Hello? 

Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.

No! That's just what I look like. See?

AWESOM-O?

When do you think uh it'll get here?

Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?

Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!

Gaaaah!

Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.

Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.

Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.

Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.

Oh sweet Jesus!

Oh Jesus! They were??

How come uh, I can't see?

What's Raisins?

Mom. Dad.

How come?

But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.

Haaah! 

Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 

Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.

This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!

Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! 

Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 

Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.

Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?

No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!

...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.

Ah I will, Mom.

Oh God. I missed you so much.

Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!

I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.

Oh boy!

Uh hey Eric!

Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!

And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!

He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.

AWESOM-O?!

Heheh, yeah. 

So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?

You can see the momma bird fly in.

Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.

They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!

I didn't say anything. I promise.

Are we gonna get tested on this?

We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.

Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now

Rotten boobie turds!

Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.

...What? What do you mean?

Dad's a good shopper all right.

Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.

All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...

Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?

You mean it?

Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.

Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?

Hold on, fellas!

Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.

Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!

Haaaah!

...Uh, who's Jack?

Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.

For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.

Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!

PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-

Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 

Biggest story about who?

Well done!

Haba, haba! Habahoaha! 

Little white lies?

AAAAAAHHH! 

Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!

Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?

No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!

Yeah, I can't believe it!

No.

Oh boy, I sure am nervous.

Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.

There you go. You're back on the track.

Let us not forget what happens this day!

Uh, how come?

Yeah. 

Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 

Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.

Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.

Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!

We know. It's preposterous.

Aw, poor girl.

Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 

I don't play World of Warcraft.

That's me!

Eavesdropper?

Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!

Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.

Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.

Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.

That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!

Huh, invasion pran.

Hah! 

Uh, I won't tell anybody.

Oh...

That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 

What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?

Hi, Mom and Dad!

Do you need to wash your hands?

Meheecan

Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!

Does this mean... you have to go now?

Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 

Hey Eric.

Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 

Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.

Oh no. Which book was that?

Stan and Kyle are really good at it.

Man this sucks!

...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!

Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.

Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 

He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!

Uh, hey, fellas.

No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!

Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.

Well Eric did. 

Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!

Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.

The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!

Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?

Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.

Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?

Guess!

Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!

Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"

Yup!

Triceratops!

Robbed us of our innocence... 

Well what do we do now?

Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.

Hey guys!

Sure, Kyle.

Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 

Nobody likes meee...

Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.

...ow... Ow... It's not workin'

Yeah?

Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh

How are things... oing with your new best friend?

Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.

Oh jeez...

Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 

Hey! Let's run naked through the street! 

The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!

Huh s-s-super-AIDS?

Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.

Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!

But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.

Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 

Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.

...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.

Yeah!

Yeah, he's a champion alright.

Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.

Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?

Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.

But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-

Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.

...ow... Ow!

Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work

Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?

Well okay, I'm sorry!

My weiner??

Woo. We aren't havin' a party.

No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!

WHY?!

Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.

Yeah, that must be his.

Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 

Okay.

Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??

Oh. Well, uh okay. 

Yeah, I finished it!

I sure hope this works.

Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! 

AAAAH!

AAAAH!  I'll get over! 

Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!

Me too!

Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!

Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-

...Die??

Then do it, if you're not yellow! 

Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?

Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.

Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.

Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.

I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!

Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!

What?

Huh?

Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.

AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.

Eh, but then why did they come back to the past

Uh yeah, ah I think so.

That was fast.

Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.

That's me!

I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 

Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 

Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 

Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.

It is true!

Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!

Oh boy!

Oh no, what did I do this time?

Uh, Mr. Garrison?

When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.

Lie about celebrities.

Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.

Yeah!

Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.

Oh well, hi there everybody. 

I love you too, Dad.

Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.

I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!

What's... bi-curious?

Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!

I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.

Aw, we're still grounded?

Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 

We're gonna get it now!

Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.

No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!

I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.

Red Lobster!

Hey look, somebody lost their pet.

Huh... 

All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.

Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!

Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.

That's me!

So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!

Uhwhat?

Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore.
I'm not makin' a face, mom!

Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.

First, just let Butters sseee the precious.

Uh here comes an SUV. 

Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.

O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.

W-what party?

Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!

Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?

Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.

What?

Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?

Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.

Hey Eric.

Whoa!

That way it won't matter if you get detention.

Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 

Well, I'm scared. 

Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?

Hi Aunt Nellie! 

Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.

Slash is make-believe??

Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.

Really?

Waaaaaah!

Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!

I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.

NO I I'm not a scab.

That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  

Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.

Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!

Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.

I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.

Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.

Hey Eric! 

Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!

Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.

He's diabetic.

Awww, that's okay, Bradley.

That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!

Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!

How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?

Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.

Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 

What is that?

P-please don't ice me, homie?

Uh-get set. Go! 

He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!

Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?

Waaaahh!

Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.

Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 

Let him have it, Stan!

There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.

What's that, Dad?

Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.

I understand. 

Well sure.

But why?

It evaporates.

Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 

Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.

Better prizes.

My grandma is from Virginia. 

Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.

Oh, okay! 

Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.

Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.

Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!

Okay, I got it!

Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-

Yeah.

I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.

OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.

Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!

Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.

Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.

Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?

Almost time. 

Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!

Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.

Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!

Wull what is it?

Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.

Hang on now.

Noooo!

...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.

Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 

Every single night.

Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 

Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!

It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!

Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 

Huh. Huh, uh, uh.

Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!

The Geniuses...

Yes!

From Eric.

Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.

Aw nuts!

Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!

Go away! You aren't real!

Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!

I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!

Bill Clinton.

Ahh, dangit! 

You think I'm ugly-ehehee...

Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! 

Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 

Sure.

Yeh, you didn't? 

What?

Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.

Not working out?

Aww. Dangit. 

I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 

Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!

Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.

We're going! 

Uh, what's that?

Okay. 

Eh, just about.

No. I like bein' bi-curious.

Wuh well, sure. 

Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?

Huh, where are we goin'?

Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 

Dwaah!!

But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.

Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.

Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.

Uh what's the matter, Scott?

I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!

Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 

You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!

Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.

Huh?

What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?

Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!

Oh hamburgers.

I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.

Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!

We're not fans!

Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!

At Red Robster. 

Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?

It's megasuperhilarious! 

Aw, I feel silly.

Base! 

Uh- perfect.

Okay. I'm not lookin'. 

Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.

Thank you! 

But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?

I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.

Ruh, really?

Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.

Wwuhuh-o-kay! 

Oh God, oh my God no! 

The union? Oh, that's why you came?

Hey! Everything okay, Stan?

What do you want?

She chickened out!

Oh. Yeah.

Stop it!

Look! The Mexican border!

Bleh, ogayedmi.

Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!

Me?!

Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?

Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 

Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.

They've got special effects! 

Really?

Hey Eric!

But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.

Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-

Oh hey Dad.

But I can't see nothin'.

I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!

Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...

What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!

I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. 

Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!

Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.

Yes sir.

Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.

W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!

DAD! Hey Dad!

Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.

Hwaaaah!!

Kyle did that? Gee whiz.

Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.

Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.

I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-

Oh. He-he says they're in there. 

I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 

Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 

Yeah, me too.

Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.

Who's George R. R. Martin?

What? What happened? 

When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!

Well, not a hundred percent...

Santa. Saaanta.

That's me!

Woo-oh Holy Cow! 

Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!

I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 

Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.

That's right.

Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.

We're from Hawaii?

There's vampires in the school!

I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 

I've never done this before. 

No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!

Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 

Oh. Okay, thanks.

Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.

Yeah.

Heh yeah, later, puss.

Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!

Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!

Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 

No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 

Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"

Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.

Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.

One dollar pledge!

Oh. Yes?

Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!

I seriously didn't mean it.

It's a kissing company.

What's "saimin"?

I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.

Two years ago. Two years ago!

Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 

bu- but fellas, I gotta- 

Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.

Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.

Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.

Oh well, we're busted. 

Man...

H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 

I'm bi-curious.

Me, Butters.

Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?

...Okay.

HAAAAH! 

But, you told me I did!

I'm not lettin' go!

No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 

Uh what's the Barrier?

Huh?

Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!

I think someone's in there.

Hawww, you lived?

Oh my God, let me see!

Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.

Whoa!

Herro, prease.

Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.

Oh sorry, sorry. 

No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.

Lie?

Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!

Eric, are you sure you can do this?

Well, sure I can see you.

Kill your mom?

Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?

I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

Let's do this!

Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!

Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!

I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Uh, hey Dad.

That's me.

Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.

Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 

Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!

Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.

Hey, where are you going?

Oh Jeez...

Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 

We could have our very own...  kissin' company.

Well, there's only like four races to choose from-

Yeah! 

Yeah.

Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.

I told you, we can't go to my house!

Wu-what sound?

Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.

Eric, stop it!

Aw man.

Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.

I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!

How do you know?

What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!

Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 

Thank you! 

Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!

Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-

Sick!

Come on, Kyle!

He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 

Haaaah.

Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.

Okay. 

Pass this up.

Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.

Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. 

Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 

Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.

I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.

Waaahaa!

The Chinese?

Wuhuff, woof, woof.

Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 

So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 

Yeh you're still here.

Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!

Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!

Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.

Huh?

I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 

Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.

Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?

Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! 

Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 

Uh, that's me!

Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.

Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.

Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-

Y-yeah!

Oh...

Me too!

Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 

Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?

She's coming! She's coming!

We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!

You just got me busted forever!

Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.

Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?

Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!

Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.

I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!

"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"

Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!

And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 

No, I'm sick of it!

Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?

Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.

Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!

Oh God! Oh Jesus! 

Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?

How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 

No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!

Ah, shucks! 

We already got a dollar!

Jesus is a lie?

Oh, all right, then. 

Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!

Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.

Eric? Iiis that you?

Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?

All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!

But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.

But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-

Game on!

Wow.

Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!

Woohoohoohoohoo!

It's true!

Yeah.

Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.

Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 

I'm sure! There's no way!

Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!

Cartman?

Well alright then.

See ya, Lisa! 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

No!

He's bi-curious too?

Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?

We-ell hold on a second, you guys.

What circuit?

Please. It's urgent.

Wait! W-why does it have to be me??

Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 

Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!

Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.

Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!

I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?

Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?

Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.

You didn't read them?

Like me!

Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.

Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.

Huh?

Well. Alright, then. 

Oh, okay. 

Yeah.

Uhh alright then. 

Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!

Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 

Awww.

Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.

Uh- go where?

Huh?

So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 

U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.

Hello? Eh-anybody in here?

Well he is.

Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 

Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!

Huh-Hallelujah!

Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?

By, by my, by myself?

Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.

Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.

We came over to cheer you up, Stan!

You don't know how hard it is to be me. 

Wuh, that's my face, sir.

Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.

...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!

No! 

They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.

You sure you want to do this?

Now you know my terrible secret!

Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?

Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 

Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 

We got it. We got it!

Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.

Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.

Who-what's a hummer??

Ha-a how come I gotta go first?

Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??

Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.

...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 

No, you took it all!

Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.

Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.

You're perfectly normal, Bradley.

Oh gosh!

Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 

Yeah, it sure has.

Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.

My mom?  Hello?

I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!

So we wanted to come here and be pirates.

Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!

Mrs. Cartman?

Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!

Yeah!

What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.

I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 

AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 

I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.

Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 

Yeah Kyle?

And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!

Wow, Jared!

Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.

Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 

And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.

You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.

Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.

GAA HAA!

Another two dollars!

Y yes, yes sir. 

But they-ah they're angry at me.

Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.

Thanks, Dad.

This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!

They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?

Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?

Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 

Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 

Whoa... 

Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.

Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.

You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?

We aren't makin' that much, fellas.

Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 

A gun?

They're gonna do it!

Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.

Another week?  I hate my stupid face.

Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-

Red Lobster!

I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.

Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 

Huuuhhhh, no.

Hi Dad! 

Aw, heck. 

Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?

Whoa.

That's fuckin' gay as hell.

I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.

Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 

Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 

I don't want my parents to die.

Lemmiwinks? NO!

Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 

Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.

Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!

It's all quiet out front, Eric.

Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.

Oh boy!

That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"

Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.

Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!

Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?

Red Lobster!

Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 

Okay! 

Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!

Nuh uh!

HAAAAA! 

Got it. 

How about we read each other's future?

Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-

I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.

Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 

Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!

"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."

He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!

It's not?!

You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 

But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.

A surprise? What is it?

To the gym.

Murder porn?

W-what?

Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!

Thanksgiving is about murder?

I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!

I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!

You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?

Huh??

Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!

Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.

Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.

Lobster Boy?

Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?

Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.

Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! 

Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.

Hu-oh! Goody!

Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.

What's "port"?!

Prostitute!

Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.

Whoopie! G and R Railroad!

But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.

Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 

Okay, okay.

Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 

...No.

What kind do we want?!

Me neither. 

REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.

All right! 

Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.

O-kay!

Just hold it. That's what I do now. 

You have to be careful with scissors.

Eric?

Broke fence...

Oh Jesus! Wait.

Well, count me out.

What's sarcasm and what's com?

I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 

Uhhh a few hundred thousand?

Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?

Uhyep.

Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 

Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?

HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!

And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."

Stupider than Bebe!

There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!

Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!

What?? 

Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.

You said I'm ugly and flat.

Yes sir! 

Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.

Aw hamburgers. 

Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 

Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!

Well all right! 

We are?

I don't want a gun, Eric!

That's me.

Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?

...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.

Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Have a good day! 

Uh... outside? No way! 

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 

Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.

Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.

All week long, bossman say

Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?

Whoa, look at it!

Mmuh well, not really, no.

Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.

Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please

Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!

Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.

Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-

Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!

Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.

...No.

Uh, is this the Stotch residence?

Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.

Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.

Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?

No, Eric. I don't wanna d-

In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.

I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.

Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.

Are we out in the destruction?

II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.

So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?

Aw man.

Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!

Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.

Okay.

Sexy Action School News Team, ho! 

Poop- poop swatches?

Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?

Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!

Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 

Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.

Yes! Yes, anything else?

Whoopie!

Whoopie! 

What's the game?

Oh hamburgers! 

The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.

Wha-what do you want me to do?

We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.

Wow.

I don't know what you mean.

AAAH!

While people play in the sun all day

Okay Dad.

Are you sure?

Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?

Hi, Grandma!

Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.

Yeah, I guess.

Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 

Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!

Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!

You're a liar!

Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?

You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 

Oh.  Alright, then. I-

Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!

Oh no!

Oh, it's all sticky. 

Wuh, wait, well, what happened??

Well I just... used my imagination.

Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?

I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 

We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 

The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.

It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.

Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!

Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.

The who?

Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.

Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-

Wha? Awww.

Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 

Huh?

Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?

I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.

I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.

Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.

Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money

Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.

Woof woof.

Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...

Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.

Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.

Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.

Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 

Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.

Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.

I'll never let go! 

Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 

Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?

I'm gonna fall! 

Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?

I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?

Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 

Well yeah.

Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.

Go where?

I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!

Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!

What the heck are you doing?!

Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.

But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.

You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?

Aw thanks.

I feel Stan! He looks totally real!

Let me have the tape!

You will?

Aww, that's okay, Eric.

Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!

Oh uh, ho yeah.

Not me! I'm a squirrel!

I donno.

Whoa.  Neat-o.  Well, this is good.

Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.

Fing fong ting tong.

Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!

See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-

That's me!

How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.

You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?

Whoa!

A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 

Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 

Hey Stan, I have a note for you.

Can I go now?

Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?

Huh?

Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.

You died?? How??

Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.

I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!

Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 

Well yeah, but... we usually win.

Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?

Oh, that's okay. I think...

I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!

He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 

No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!

Oh.

I touched Wendy's boobs. 

Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.

Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?

Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?

Hey, robots don't fart!

Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?

Of course not!

Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.

But I just did what he told me!

Eh yeah I do too!

He's a peckerface, that's what he is!

Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.

My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 

Huh?

Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.

That's Lisa Berger?

Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-

Oh... 

Join me?

Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 

Aaah! Nooo! 

It's, it's... I just had it! 

I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?

Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!

We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.

But Wendy's coming to fight you.

I'm hung like a horse!

Well okay! Let's do it!

Really?

Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 

Let me see!

Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.

Whoa.

Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?

Uh, sure.

Well sure, I guess.

Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 

Yes!

He's right, lads. To adventure!

Well actually, Eric, it's you. 

Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!

Awww jeez, you're no fun. 

Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!

Let's do it!

You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??

Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!

Uh, it sure is!

Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 

I'm here, Eric.

What?! Well since when?

Waah! 

Stop breathin'?

Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 

Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.

"White Swallow Bath House"

Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.

Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 

All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 

Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 

Because I'm bi-curious?

You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?

But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.

Somebody killed Kickstarter!

Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!

Uhhh, yeah.

Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?

What's that?  Awww! 

Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!

Oh, no. Oh, geez!

This is, General Disarray. My final solution. 

All right, Eric, come on, Eric.

Yeah,  fuck 'em.

But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?

They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 

Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.

Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 

Hey Lexus.

No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!

Whoa, I'm getting woozy.

Well it's not where I aimed, honest.

Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.

Yes, it's all very confusing!

Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?

Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!

Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?

Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?

AAAAHH!

That was a very informative speech, Kyle.

Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.

But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 

Yeah. He's a badass! 

Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!

Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 

How?

Oh no!

Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.

Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?

Okay.  Ow. Ooww!

Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.

...Pretty good.

Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!

This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.

No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.

Well sure I do.

Happy Anniversary!

Huh?

What's this?

You mean it's like, like a monster?

Ohhh hamburgers! 

I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.

No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 

Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?

Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.

Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.

Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.

You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!

Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.

Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.

Uh, that's me!

You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 

Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.

I am.

Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!

Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians

Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-

No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.

Oh, Stan!

I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.

Hey, I was about to win!

Oh hey Eric.

Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.

My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.

Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.

I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!

Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!

Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.

But I don't want to see you!

Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!

Huh? Why?

Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.

Hey fellas.

WHAT?? 

Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.

Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.

Oh no, my Dad?

Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 

Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.

No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.

Eric! Uh what are you doing here?

"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."

OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!

Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 

The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.

Wuh it's me, Butters.

What what what?

Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.

12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.

It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.

Jesus!

Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.

Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!

The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 

Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.

Ahhh!

Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.

Okay, I'm back in your room!

You mean like Jared?

Wahh!

Yes sir.

Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.

...Yeah. 

The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?

Hey! Here they come! 

Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 

NO Wikileaks! Bad!

Oh God, I'm scared.

Get out of here, all of ya! 

Oh uh, hi Mom.

Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.

Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.

Kenny, be careful!

How much further to Castle Sunshine?

Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.

Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 

Whoa boy! Camp!

Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.

Cheese!

Oh jeez!

Well, uh I sure am, I guess.

Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.

It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 

Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 

There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 

He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!

Heheyehah.

That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!

Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!

Wuh, what can I do?

Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 

Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?

Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!

Whoa, it's like gasoline!

More of the school. 

I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!

I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!

Make that two! 

So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!

Ehthat was pretty good.

We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!

Viva la Meheeco!

What? Why would I do that?

Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 

General Disarray, are your parents home?

Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.

Wow! Neato!

Cool, thanks.

Who?

Ohhh, we lost?

Darling!

Before what happens? 

You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?

Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?

No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!

Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.

Uhh rrreeally are you sure?

Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.

Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.

It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 

Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?

Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!

I waited all night for you to get off work.

What's this all about, Eric?

I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.

Where is Mr. Hat, sir?

Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. 

No! No! Noooooo!

Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!

Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.

Interim status is go.

My Grandma?

Oh, well, here he is.

Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?

Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.

Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!

Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!

But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.

Sure I do!

Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.

Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.

I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 

That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.

You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.

Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 

Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-

Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.

Ms. Choksondik,

Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.

Hokay. 

Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.

Dangit, I wish I knew people.

But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-

Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!

Huwhoa! 

Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!

Yeah!

So where's the part where we have a good time?

Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.

I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?

Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 

Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."

Aw, I did it again?

Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?

Huh?

Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.

I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?

I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 

It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!

I got World of Warcraft, like you said.

Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 

NASCA- NASCAR?

What?

Oh, heh-hey dad.

Sir, I'm confused.

I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!

Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?

That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.

Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.

A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!

Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.

She's pretty!

Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.

Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?

Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.

Ah, all right then.

Wuh who are you talking about?

Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.

I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-

Whoops. 

How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?

Oh, now we're gonna get it.

Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 

I don't follow.

...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.

Okay, but... what are you going to do?

All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!

I'll miss you too, ghost pal.

There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!

Oh no.

You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?

Wow.

Oh. Double hamburgers.

Huh?

Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 

Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.

Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!

AAAAHH! 

Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?

Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 

So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.

Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!

So that's it? We're broken up now?

No- but you don't sound like me.

Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.

I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-

Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.

You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.

Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.

Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 

Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!

Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?

Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.

Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.

Be careful! The powerlines!

Hi, Dad.

Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 

Dad?  Dad, you in here?

Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.

Hey ugly! 

Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 

Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 

Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-

Hey fellas!

You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!

We can't tell you.

Really?

Oh hamburgers! What is that?? 

Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?

Well, gay is wholesome.

That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.

Oh. Hey Wendy.

Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.

Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.

Ahhh well oh- kay.

Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!

Uhbu-but I'm from here.

Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!

No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!

Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.

Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!

Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?

I have no idea, sir.

Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.

Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.

Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 

I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.

Hey, fellas!

Oh neato, huh fellas?

Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.

Happy Deadline Day!

Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!

Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 

Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.

Sir? Hello?

I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.

Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?

But I gotta get back to my family.

Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!

Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 

Ah, sí señor.

Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!

Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?

Oh, she said it again!

Huhuh, look at all this stuff.

Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.

Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.

My dad said it's not for spying on people.

Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 

AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!

Whoa!

Ah, I was at home.

Come on! What are you guys goin' as?

Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!

Ohhh, he's got her now!

Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.

They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!

He had sins that he didn't confess!

Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.

Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!

Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?

Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.

Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?

People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!

Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.

No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!

Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.

Oh hamburgers!

Well yeah, I s'psoe

Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 

But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?

No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 

You... you and your cousin touched wieners?

Uhh,  mahjey burazi?

Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.

42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 

Whoa! 

"What What (In The Butt)," sir.

I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.

Now wees hases it! 

Kenny!

Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.

Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.

That's me!

Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.

Oh, Jesus, see me through this.

Aaaah!

Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.

Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.

Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??

Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!

And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.

Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.

I don't know what to do!

Hah?

Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?

Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?

This is for all the times I got grounded! 

Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.

Am I just an asshole?

Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!

Ew, they're all dirty.

We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.

That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 

What??

Surrender?! No, the heck with that!

This place is awesome!

No way!

Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!

Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!

Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.

I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.

That's me!

Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.

Ow...

Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.

Huh... 

Ahhh, huh?

Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 

Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 

It hurts! It hurts! 

Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.

Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!

Me too.

Yes, it's me.

Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.

I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.

No, uh Craig's here, too.

So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!

Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!

Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 

Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 

Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?

Huh... Oh, it's terrible.

Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 

Then we gotta work on your campaign.

Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 

Oh no! Kenny!

Hey, fellas! 

Uh hey, wait a minute! 

Eric! Don't ever talk like that!

Oh Jeez!

Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.

But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 

Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!

Yeah...I guess it is...

Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 

All right! Cartman's president. We did it.

Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.

Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.

One please.

I'm back, Ma!

What?

Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!

Hey fellas!

Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.

Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.

Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.

I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!

Aaaa!! 

Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 

Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.

Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 

Eeyeah, I'm psyched.

Stupid news hair! 

Hmmm, it's kind of gay.

Awwwww.

Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.

Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?

Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!

Um, excuse me?

How do I do that?

Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.

Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 

Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!

Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.

And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?

Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.

You killed her! 

Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.

I love our class!

Whoa...

Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?

I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.

He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 

W-we are.

I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.

Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.

Hehyeah?

We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.

Let's dance. 

Boy, that was a great episode!

It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?

Oh hamburgers! 

Lu lu lu, lu lu lu 

Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.

Haah! Leave me alone! 

On my girlfriend.

I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 

You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?

Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.

Been a hoot all right!

I am?

Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 

Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.

Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 

O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!

Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.

So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-

Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?

There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..

Yes.

You do?

Oh, thanks.

Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!

He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.

Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?

Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?

How?

Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.

Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.

Okay, thanks. 

Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?

Is that really all our wiener sizes?

But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?

Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!

...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Holy moly! 

Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.

I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.

Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.

I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 

Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.

Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.

It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!

Really?

You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.

I know what you're saying.

Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!

I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 

Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!

Hoh.

No, you're good. 

Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!

Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 

Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.

Yeah!

Oh wow!

Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 

Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 

Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?

Ow! Dad?

That looks dangerous.

Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 

Ooohhhh!

Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!

Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!

Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.

Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!

Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!

We're crossin' the border!

Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 

Well at least there's that.

Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.

Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.

Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.

U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.

Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 

...A pimp. Huh...

Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?

Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 

Huh?

They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!

I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.

That's me!

It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!

Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?

Good night, fellas!

But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!

Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.

HA?!

Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?

Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!

I do love water balloons. 

I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!

Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?

Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 

They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!

What?! Oh no!

Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.

Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-

I love you too, ladies. 

Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.

Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.

I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.

My name's Butters.

That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.

Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?

Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.

Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 

No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.

Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.

Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!

Woof woof. 

Sure, I love the Truth.

Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!

I wonder how long I'm grounded for?

Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.

Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?

AAAAH! 

You folks are all native Hawaiians too?

The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.

Whre do we go? Where do we go?

Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.

Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.

So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?

Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.

Feel stupid yet?

Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.

You said "go ahead".

Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.

Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?

If this doesn't work, we're dead.

Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 

Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?

Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 

He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?

Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.

Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 

I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.

Oh, hi Eric.

Uh w-where??

Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.

Yeah! Dumb girls!

Skeletor is real??

Double wow! 

Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!

Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 

Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.

It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.

Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?

Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.

Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?

Wow, that's gonna be so fun!

Oh, boy!

That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!

Do you see any Indians?

But they killed Lemmiwinks!

Will do.

Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 

I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?

NO!

Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?

More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!

Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.

Whoops! 

Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!

I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?

Really? Do you think that's best?

Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 

Yeah!

Oh. Hey fellas.

Wow, you really know what you're doing.

Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.

Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.

But he's dying! 

What?

They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-

Sorry! 

Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 

I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 

Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.

Shouldn't we get him back in the water?

Well what the heck do we do now?

Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.

HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?

Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?

Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.

Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.

Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!

Well that sounds good.

Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-

Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.

Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 

Theh theh, there she is. 

What?

I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 

Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?

Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.

No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!

Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 

WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.

Well but, but what happened?

It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.

Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.

Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!

Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 

No! 

Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 

Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?

...Ohhh!

Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.

HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.

Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 

I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?

Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!

Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.

Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-

Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!

Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 

I ain't grounded, am I?

But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 

Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?

How come?

'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.

Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!

Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.

Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.

Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.

Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 

Boy, it sure is stinky in here!

Hey Dad. 

Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 

Everything's getting dark...

It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!

Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!

Aaaaah!

Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.

I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!

How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!

Sure.

Aaah. 

My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!

Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!

Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.

Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?

Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?

Stupid Simpsons...

Huh?

Well yeah!

Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.

Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?

Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.

Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.

No, Eric! 

Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?

"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.

Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!

Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?

Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?

We lost?

Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.

Hear hear.

AAAAAHHH!

Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 

You mean, like a goldfish?

Really?

Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.

They're putting an end to it! 

Come on, Stan! 

They're gonna do it! 

Hallelujah!

Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.

I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!

One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.

God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!

It's gonna be okay, Eric.

Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 

What's a PewDiePie do?

We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 

Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 

He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!

The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!

...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.

Hey! Where do you think you're going?!

Huh.

Wuh what are you gonna do?

What??

Oh, that'd be awesome! 

This is gonna be great!

When?

Wow! That was cool!

Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!

You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 

Who's coming this way?

Wuh-what's the matter?

N-no reason! 

Yes ma'am. 

Ahhh shit.

That you hate Smurfs?

Okey doke.

Huuh what's the matter?

Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.

I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.

Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.

Wow wee, look at him go!

Woahhh!

Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 

Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.

I just see stars. 

I'm freaking out...

Yes, they will.

Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?

Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 

How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.

Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 

Waaaaah!

Well, what are we waitin' for?!

Huh, that was incredible!

She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!

Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.

Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 

Suppornity window dropped. 

Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?

I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 

Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 

Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!

Waaaa! 

The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.

Boy, we sure did.

Oh I know.

What's up fellas?

Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.

Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?

Fellas! Where'd you come from? 

No.

I love you too, Dad. 

A well-organized pantry.

Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?

Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 

Ye-!  wait, what?

Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 

They'll find love somewhere else.

Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?

Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.

OH GOSH!

Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!

Ehyeah!

Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.

Oh really?

Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?

Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...

Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.

Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 

I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??

Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.

Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 

Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?

Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.

AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!

Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 

Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?

Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.

Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. 

I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.

Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?

I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 

W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 

Please, leave me alone.

Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."

Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!

You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.

You bet!

Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?

Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 

Haaa!

A note?

Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?

Yes.

Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?

But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?

Hey Dad!

Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.

Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.

Aren't you coming?

Huh?

Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.

Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!

Oh no!

Precious! 

Obama's fuckin' gay.

Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.

You seemed really stupid, Eric.

Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.

This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.

You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?

I just... w-was seein' if it works.

Uugh!

Hey, do you guys smell that?

I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
