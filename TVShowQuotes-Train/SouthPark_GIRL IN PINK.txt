Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!
Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! 
Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. 
Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!
This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!
I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!
Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!
How about a race down a real hill, then?!
See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!
