See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!
Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. 
How about a race down a real hill, then?!
Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!
Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!
Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!
Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! 
These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!
Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!
