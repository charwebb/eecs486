That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,
Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?
I decided I was going to make you dinner.
Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.
So, is the chop the way you like it?
Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.
You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.
Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions.
. . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .
Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.
