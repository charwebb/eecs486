I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.
Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.
You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.
I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,
So, is the chop the way you like it?
Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.
When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.
I decided I was going to make you dinner.
. . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .
Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?
Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
