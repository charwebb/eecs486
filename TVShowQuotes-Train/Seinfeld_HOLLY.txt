[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
Spooning.
Hey Kevin.
Hi.
A lot of people.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
Michael, you don't have to buy them.
So you missed something really big.
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Yeah.
No, he's not funny at all.
No! No.
Let me see.
It's the gas station on Benet Street?
Oh.
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
It was just for a few weeks!
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
It's Mike-raculous.
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
Of course. Yeah.
Next day I found him in my bed.
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
[imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
She's with Angela.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
No.  I can do it.
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
What happened here?
We live together.
Look at where my seats were.
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Okay.
No.
Almost, Kevin.
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin]
It was blue cheese dressing.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
Oh. Good for you guys.
No more.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
In Summer.
Yeah, it was nice.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
Oh, no.
All right.
Wow! Nice.
Obesity-caused illnesses.
Oh, it's just later.
No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing.
Kidding.
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
They didn't know?
Hi.
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
That's certainly opinionated.
[with accent] Wonderful seminar!
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Well, what do you like to eat?
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Yeah.
We don't know that.
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
Ok.
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
You think this is funny?
How do you know when its time?
For what?
I loved it.
[enters conference room] Hello.
Crystal cool.
I can't wait.
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
Uhm...
No. Mom?
Would you put those out?
So we kiss occasionally.
No, I understand.
Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
I have no idea.
Oh... when did you get here?
Mmhmm.
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Michael.. [they both laugh]
Why?
What are you doing up here?
Yeah, that's good.
[laughs] Lovitz.
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Oh, good for you.
No.
I've dated four guys last year too.
Okay.
What do you do in your free time?
All right.
Oh, wow... you went together?
Oh--- no no no.
Hindsight.
No! You do not talk to him like that!
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
[giggles] Sorry.
Hi Dad.
[imitating E.T.] Bummer.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
No more brain damage.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
Okay.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
You OK?  You seem kind of...
What was the dilemma?
[hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!
[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
He knows how to get things. He got me.
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
[chuckling] No, that's not what you're grabbing.
That's so lame they didn't invite us.
Great.
Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
You never told me you made a movie.
Yeah.
Ahh!
It would help.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
Uh, what?
I am?
Years?
Well, I'll be around.
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
Actually, I'm a lesbian.
Yeah, kind of.
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
It's a pea shoot...
Michael, I'm sorry.
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
[Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Thank you, you too.
No.
Okay.
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Okay, yeah.
Mmm.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
[to camera] No, he didn't.
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Is he okay?
Great.
Which way did he go?
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Hello.
No.
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Yeah.
[on phone] This is Holly.
What? What are you talking about?
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Michael... [Michael hangs up]
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
I love you.
Oh.
It's not a family.  It's a workplace.
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
Yeah.
Okay. Bye.
We're only halfway?
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Not worried about that.
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
I don't think we'd have kids.
Yeah.
You do?
Honey, he's a jerk.
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
[laughs] I can't wait.
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
Michael I think this is our fault.
I don't think he's funnier than me.
Unnnnnnngh!
[on phone] Hello there!
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
No.
I don't know.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
I remember.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
Well, some girls go through a phase.
Well, I'm glad we did it.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
I love pie.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
Michael, I should get back to work.
Listen about earlier ...
Breaker one-nine, copy?
I missed you too.
Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.
Hmm...
Hi.
Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
What are you doing?
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
You romanticize things.
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Two people in love?
Oh, it's very nice.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
Uhm.
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
I'm real.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Yoga.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
I do, I think so.
I knew that. OK, bye.
[kisses his temple] Thank you.
No, you.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
Yeah.
Put....okay....
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
You're better than betterest.
I know, but from seven hours away.
How long could we keep that up?
They're warm.
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
We have to try this out on somebody.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Ex-squeeze me.
Hi.
What'd you think?
Michael, are you okay?
Oh...
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
And here.
Yeah.
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
That is correct!
Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
A chastity belt.
No.
Yeah.
Oh, God, no.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
Michael called Dad?
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
No.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
Yeah.
Okay. Good night.
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
No, hey.
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
Yes.
Ooh!
Hello.
So, I've gone over corporate policy.
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
What's protocol on this?
Yeah.
I love the view.
You'll be okay
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
I love you too.
Are their egg rolls really that big?
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Hey! Good movie.
I know.
No, no, I...
Almost got you.
I already have.
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Hey there.
Well, no. Dwight...
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
No touching.
Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
How's she doing?
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
We weren't in love last time.
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
[unlocking front door] This is me here.
Why?
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Yes. Number three.
Mmm.
Oh that would be great.
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
Math is hard.
That is correct!
Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Look I need to talk to you.
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
What?
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
What's wrong?
Yeah, thanks.
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
You must be Todd.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
It's got you.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
Dunder Mifflin.
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
He is not an idiot!
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
You're shaking. Are you all right?
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
I love you.
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
Look, Darryl, lip up.
Oh I'm going.
I'm going out with you.
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
Bye.
...Hell yeah.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
20
This is your moms old stuff?
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Sorry, Darryl.
What do you do?
No you don't.
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Okay, one more quick one.
No. No... no Dad.
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
Okay.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Well who do you have?
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
[plants kisses all over Michael's face]
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Yep. Just like you.
You too.
[playing cards] It's time to go.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
AJ gave me that.
Well-
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
We punish her?
I love you too.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
[overdramatically] Acting!
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
Ooh, uh...
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
Yes.
Oh...
I just... Um, excuse me.
[tool clicking] Damn it!
Who ahh?
Can I sit?
You guys, it wasn't my fault.
Let's check there.
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
Darryl didn't want any?
You are more.
All right.
Darryl....
Oh.
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
I'm Robert Dunder.
Mmm. Do you like movies?
Uh... which part?
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Oh, the mall could be fun.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
And I like you too.
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Michael....
I'm sorry about your friend.
That-That's my car.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
Really?
You said you would.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah. I love him.
Ohh. Can you get lower?
Lemonade sounds great.
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Can I talk to you for a second?
You're better.
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Sounds good.
Yes, Michael?
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
You're not touching me.
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Hey.
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
Oh, she's very beautiful.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Mmm hmm.
That's good.
10 dollars.
There weren't any laughs.
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
Okay, great.  I got it.
Down, and give me 50!
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
No, you can have your own opinion.
Really?
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Um, not much.
Oh, of course you are.
You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
What? AJ!
You are.
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Hey, what's up guys?
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Oh I already bought this...
Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Wikka wikka wikka what?
It's not gonna work.
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
What ah you wicked smaht?
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
No, I don't think so.
No, don't touch.
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
No.
13 dollars.
Snuggles.
I don't care, free tonight.
Ok.
What do you do here?
Dun-der. Dun-der...
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Yeah, lets go grab them.
Cool! You drive your own car?
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
Nice
Did Todd tell you to do that?
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
Hold your breath!
You know... in case if something changes.
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
[as Curly] I most certainly am.
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Oh.
Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
No this is Holly.
