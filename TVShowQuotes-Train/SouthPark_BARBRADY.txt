You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 
Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. 
But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!
Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.
That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
Okay, so just what is going on here, people?
Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. 
Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?
Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?
We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry.
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!
Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
"Whoosh!" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes
I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.
Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.
To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!
I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
"Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."  I read it! I read it all by myself! 
It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? 
Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!
All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? 
Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.
Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? 
Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 
"Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!
Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.
Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! 
I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.
Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.
Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!
Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!
I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!
Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! 
Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.
B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. 
Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
