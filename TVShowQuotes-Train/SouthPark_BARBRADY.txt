Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!
Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! 
"Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!
Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!
Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.
Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!
Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.
Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.
That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!
We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry.
Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. 
Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. 
But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
"Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."  I read it! I read it all by myself! 
Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?
Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? 
Well then, I have to take you to jail.
Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 
I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!
Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!
Okay, so just what is going on here, people?
Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? 
So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 
Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.
I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.
Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. 
Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? 
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.
Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. 
Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
