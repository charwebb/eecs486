I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.

Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! 

Hello?

Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?

Freeze!

Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"

Hey! 

Thanks, boys.

How about fishing without a license?

Jakov 

Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! 

By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.

Are you sure?

Like what?

I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.

Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!

What?

Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? 

Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.

Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.

Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. 

Oh?

Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.

Goddammit!

There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!

Ahhh... O...

I need to go poopies.

I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.

Wooo!

Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?

Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?"

You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 

I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.

Ready.

Haa haa. Ha ha ha.

Oh jeez.

That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.

Where am I?

Hello, Mr. Tweek.

Who was that?

And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.

Caught you red-handed!

Who is this?

Oh?

Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!

Oh, no!  Shhh!  Keep your eyes peeled. 

Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. 

Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.

Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.

Weirdo.

Blue? 

"Pet--" Wait a minute. 

Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 

Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.

From what? Who is this?

Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. 

Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.

Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.

Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!

The usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.

I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!

Bill Cosby?

Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?

All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! 

Thank you. 

Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?

Grab him! 

I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?

Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...

Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. 

Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.

What the hell is that thing??

"Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!

"Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."  I read it! I read it all by myself! 

But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever

Damn, he's quick!

Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!

No, I'm sorry. 

The South win?

Uh. Blue is blue?

Could I see your license, please?

Okie-dokie.

Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!

Oooh, pretty good.

Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!

Okay, so just what is going on here, people?

Sorry. 

Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.

I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.

Are you serious?

Haw, camel poo.

Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!

Hello?

I, I feel really good.

Oh, that was so touching.

All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? 

Can I go now?

That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!

The short what?

I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.

Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!

Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.

Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?

Ey, put down my car! 

It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? 

Oh, yeah. There is that. 

Now, what did that clue say again?

We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry.

Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.

That's not how I played it!

Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--"

I found him.

Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.

Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?

We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!

Four? 

Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?

Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?

What's that?

Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.

What?

Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.

Uhhhh... oh. 

Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
"Whoosh!" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes

It's almost midnight.

Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!

Whoa, this is a good movie!

Well then, I have to take you to jail.

Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!

Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?

To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!

Right.

Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
