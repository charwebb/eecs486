I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.

Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?

That's not how I played it!

"Pet--" Wait a minute. 

That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.

Ey, put down my car! 

Grab him! 

To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!

But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever

Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.

Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. 

Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. 

Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.

Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!

Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.

What's that?

Oh jeez.

Oooh, pretty good.

Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
"Whoosh!" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes

Are you serious?

Uh. Blue is blue?

That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!

I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.

Now, what did that clue say again?

So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?

Right.

Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? 

Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?

What?

What?

Four? 

Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.

Haw, camel poo.

Could I see your license, please?

No, it's all me. Uh, my bad.

There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!

Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!

You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 

Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.

Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.

Like what?

Caught you red-handed!

We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!

Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!

I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.

Who was that?

B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. 

I, I feel really good.

Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?"

The short what?

Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.

Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...

I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.

Jakov 

Thanks, boys.

Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.

No, I'm sorry. 

Whoa, this is a good movie!

Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.

Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.

Hooray!

"Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!

The South win?

Okie-dokie.

What's going on back there?

Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.

Well then, I have to take you to jail.

Hey! 

Oh, no!  Shhh!  Keep your eyes peeled. 

Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?

Goddammit!

"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"

Who is this?

Oh, yeah. There is that. 

Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! 

Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?

I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.

How about fishing without a license?

Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?

Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. 

Hello, Mr. Tweek.

Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.

Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?

Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?

Damn, he's quick!

Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!

Where am I?

Oh?

Thank you. 

The usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.

Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.

We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry.

Hello?

Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.

It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? 

Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.

Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! 

Wooo!

All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? 

Ahhh... O...

Bill Cosby?

Sorry. 

Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?

Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!

Oh, that was so touching.

"Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."  I read it! I read it all by myself! 

I need to go poopies.

Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!

Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 

Hello?

Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!

Oh?

Weirdo.

Oh. 

It's almost midnight.

Come on, time to go home.

Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!

Uhhhh... oh. 

Ahhh... O... O--

Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--"

Freeze!

Ready.

Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. 

Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.

I found him.

Okay, so just what is going on here, people?

Are you sure?

Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!

I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.

Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. 

Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!

Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! 

What's this all about?
