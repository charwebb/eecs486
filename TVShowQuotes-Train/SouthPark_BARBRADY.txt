Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?
We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry.
B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. 
Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.
Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. 
Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 
There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!
Well then, I have to take you to jail.
Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
"Whoosh!" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes
So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.
Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.
Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.
Okay, so just what is going on here, people?
Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? 
All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! 
We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.
Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. 
That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? 
I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.
Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.
I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
"Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."  I read it! I read it all by myself! 
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! 
Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!
Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?
I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.
Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? 
Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 
Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!
And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!
I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.
Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!
Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
"Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
