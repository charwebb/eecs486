Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!
We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
And that chair, too. I want that chair.
You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.
Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!
I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. 
Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.
We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! 
Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?
Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there? 
Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do.
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...
I am above the law!  Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you.
Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.
Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.
Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.
Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 
Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.
Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!
We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
