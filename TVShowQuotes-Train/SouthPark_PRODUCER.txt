Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?

Noooooooo!

Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!

We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.

Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.

Remember, big, big, big! 

I am above the law! 

What are you bastards doing?

Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.

Get the Flight for Life helicopter! 

Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!

Jesus!

Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.

I can take whatever I want.

I like it. That's these boys playing?

I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.

You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!

Noooooo! 

Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?

Take 112!

Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?

Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.

And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.

We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there? 

And that chair, too. I want that chair.

Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.

We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!

You getting all this? 

It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...

Oooooohhhh!

Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Kid, can I talk to you?

What is this? What's happening?!

Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.

How are they coming?

Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!

Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.

Oh, this is not good.

That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 

Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.

No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!

That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!

You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!

Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!

You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?

Would you boys like to meet him?

Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--

He is?

You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.

Exactly! 

Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.

No!

Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do.

Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.

What is it?

Take this, too.

He'll pay her four thousand dollars.

Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.

Let me show you what I mean. 

Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?

We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts. 

Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.

Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?

Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.

You wouldn’t.

We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--

Remember, big, big, big!

I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.
