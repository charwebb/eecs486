I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
And that chair, too. I want that chair.
I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.
No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 
We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts. 
Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...
Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there? 
Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! 
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do.
Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.
You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!
Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.
I am above the law!  Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you.
Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.
Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.
