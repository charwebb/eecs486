Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.
Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there? 
Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.
Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
I am above the law!  Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you.
We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! 
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.
You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.
It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 
No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?
That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. 
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts. 
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do.
I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.
Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.
And that chair, too. I want that chair.
Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.
Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!
