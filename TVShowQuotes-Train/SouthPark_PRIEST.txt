Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about.  If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too! 
Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!
Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
"Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust." 
Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?
Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian. 
...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman.  She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother , and a loving grandmother .
This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck. 
And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives. 
And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace. 
Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.
You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!
"Yea, usher us unto the Lord", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!
Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.  What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?
