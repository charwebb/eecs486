Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.
I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya.
Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
(holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)
(getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey
And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him
I could've done more. I could've done so much more.
(to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!
We can make a whole day of it.
I was able to finagle two more tickets to "My Fair Lady" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.
Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us.
(getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?
(walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what do you say?
Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?
Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) I've heard about you.
Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.
(turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.
You sure? You could examine the art work up close.
