Thank you.
(turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.
See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss)
How about right now?
I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya.
Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?
(to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!
(up in Helen's face) Easily
I was able to finagle two more tickets to "My Fair Lady" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.
You sure? You could examine the art work up close.
Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.
(Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off.
(gets closer) Of course not.
Yea, they bought me a coke.
Bye.
Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
Yes?
You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?
(leaving) Bye
(holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)
(getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey
(Laughing) Well see you later.
Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.
Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
Ah
And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him
No, it was fun.
Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us.
We can make a whole day of it.
Buh bye.
(getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?
I could've done more. I could've done so much more.
Yes.
