I killed my grampa when I was your age.
Billy, would you mind holding this for grampa please?
I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.
Billy, help grampa stick this fork in the outlet.
Come here Billy, I want to show you something.
Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.  Come on, let's go.  What the...?
No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grampa. 
Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa. 
Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?
Come over here you son of a whore! 
Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?
That's not fair, Goddammit! My grampa asked me to kill him and I did it. 
And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
My name's not Billy, grampa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?
What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own gramparents.
I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?
