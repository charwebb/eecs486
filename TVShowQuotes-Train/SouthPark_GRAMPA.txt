Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.  Come on, let's go.  What the...?
That's not fair, Goddammit! My grampa asked me to kill him and I did it. 
And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
Uhhhhh  Ah, dammit!  How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?
Billy, help grampa stick this fork in the outlet.
Billy, would you mind holding this for grampa please?
Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.
Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa. 
I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?
Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?
No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.
Come over here you son of a whore! 
My name's not Billy, grampa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?
What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own gramparents.
I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.
Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grampa.
