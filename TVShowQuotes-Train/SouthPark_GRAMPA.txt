That's not fair, Goddammit! My grampa asked me to kill him and I did it. 

And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.

I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.

Uhhhhh.

That's good Billy, a little higher now.

Come over here you son of a whore! 

Uh, ow.

Billy, would you mind holding this for grampa please?

Grampa?

Ingrate!

Shoot me.

Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.

You pompous son of a whore!

It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.  Come on, let's go.  What the...?

No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.

So now will you kill me Billy?

Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa. 

Dammit! I was so close.

Not just yet. 

Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?

Why not?

Hey, you were supposed to kill me!

My name's not Billy, grampa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?

Tug - a - little harder, Billy.

I won! I won! 

Does the pope crap in the woods? 

Come here Billy, I want to show you something.

I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?

That's the spirit Tubby.

I wish I were dead

Uhhhhh  Ah, dammit!  How would you like to make a dollar Billy?

Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!

That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grampa. 

Limbo?

Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.

Kill me, God dammit!

Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.

I killed my grampa when I was your age.

That's right.

Uhh, cut the damn rope already! 

What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own gramparents.

But I've been waiting for 25 years.

Billy, help grampa stick this fork in the outlet.

Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
