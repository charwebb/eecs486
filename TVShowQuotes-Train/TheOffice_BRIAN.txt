So...
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
Oh, hey Meredith.
Yeah, hold on a sec.
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
What brings you by?
No, you're not crazy.
Yeah, it was cool.
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Um...
Nothing. You���re doing the best you can.
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
No no, it's-
They want to know how much what?
Hey, it���s just a tough situation, all right?
Alright, that's for you. [hands her beer]
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
Hi. [laughs]
That's not really true, I mean-
Let me grab a couple drinks.
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
Yeah.
Seeya.
That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?
Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
Oh yeah, that's right.
Will do.
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
No. No, it's...
At least my crying won't get you fired.
Cheers.
Pretty much everything.
Oh, hey!
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
Sure.
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
You're gonna hit a woman?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
