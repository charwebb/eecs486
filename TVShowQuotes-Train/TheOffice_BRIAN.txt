[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
Uh, listen, they���re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It���s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna��� I, I���ll see you later.
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
At least my crying won't get you fired.
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
Hey, it���s just a tough situation, all right?
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
