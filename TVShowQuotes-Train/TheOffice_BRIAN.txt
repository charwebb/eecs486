Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
At least my crying won't get you fired.
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
Hey, it���s just a tough situation, all right?
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
Uh, listen, they���re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It���s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna��� I, I���ll see you later.
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
