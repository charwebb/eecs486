Nothing. You���re doing the best you can.
Let me grab a couple drinks.
It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
You're gonna hit a woman?
Yeah, hold on a sec.
So...
Hey.
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
No no, it's-
Yeah.
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
Yeah, it is.
Um...
Sure.
Yeah, it was cool.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Pretty much everything.
What brings you by?
Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
No, you're not crazy.
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
Uh, listen, they���re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It���s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna��� I, I���ll see you later.
Cheers.
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
Seeya.
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
Oh, hey Meredith.
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
Will do.
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Alright, that's for you. [hands her beer]
Oh, hey!
Hi. [laughs]
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
That's not really true, I mean-
Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
