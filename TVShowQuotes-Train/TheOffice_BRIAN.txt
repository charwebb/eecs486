Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
They want to know how much what?
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
That's not really true, I mean-
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
No no, it's-
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
Cheers.
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
Yeah, it was cool.
Uh, listen, they���re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It���s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna��� I, I���ll see you later.
Hey.
Hey, it���s just a tough situation, all right?
Oh yeah, that's right.
What brings you by?
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
So...
Um...
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
Sure.
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
Oh, hey!
Oh, hey Meredith.
Alright, that's for you. [hands her beer]
No, you're not crazy.
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
Yeah, hold on a sec.
Will do.
Let me grab a couple drinks.
Seeya.
At least my crying won't get you fired.
Pretty much everything.
You're gonna hit a woman?
Yeah.
