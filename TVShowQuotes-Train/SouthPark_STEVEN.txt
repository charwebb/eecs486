Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.

Whattaya mean?

Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!

Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.

Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!

Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!

We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.

Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.

Oh yes you are!

We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.

Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.

Well, guess we don't have to ground him.

Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.

Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! 

We understand you've seen our son. 

You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!

Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!

Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! 

So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?

I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!

Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.

Hello?

Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.

Keep running, kid! 

Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.

Honey, no!

What is it, Martha?

...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-

This certainly is a friendly town.  You've all been sssssso wonderful. 

So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling "Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."

Our ssson!

That's right.

Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy.

They said to inquire four houses down.

Butters?  Butters!

That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! 

No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...

Delicious.

Aw son! 

Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.

Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. 

Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?

Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.

Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.

It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.

Butters, time for breakfast.

God dammit no! Y-you have to give them more time!

Son!

Oh, our same ol' Ben!

I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!

Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! 

Please, please. It's not your fault.

Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.

Aw, son. 

Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?

Our leader, he... he's leaving us! 

Come on, Butters, time to get up. 

Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming.

So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! 

We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.

Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did.

Yes.

Your potential hasn't even been reached.

You're out. 

Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!

You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.

Uh, Thompssson.

Well good for you, Butters.

Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head.

Damnit! Damnit!  Thanks a lot, kid!
