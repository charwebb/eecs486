I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!
You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.
No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...
Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!
Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! 
So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! 
Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.
Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs.
So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.
Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.
This certainly is a friendly town.  You've all been sssssso wonderful. 
Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-
Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!
Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.
You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!
Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! 
Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!
Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. 
Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.
Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head.
God dammit no! Y-you have to give them more time!
Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy.
Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?
We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.
We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
Well, guess we don't have to ground him.
I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!
Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!
Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming.
Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! 
Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!
So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling "Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."
If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?
