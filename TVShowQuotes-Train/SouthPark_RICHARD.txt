'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.
Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! 
Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.
That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I.
Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. 
The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.
If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.
Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight.

Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.

Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
