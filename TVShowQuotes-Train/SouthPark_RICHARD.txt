That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him. "Under God" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  "Under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.
Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo
The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.
Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. 
Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.
Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. 
That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.
He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.
Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. 
That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!
Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.
I just want to make sure that you-
Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! 
So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? 
Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. 
Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I.
Sit down and have some coffee, son.  Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about kids being abducted, and we thought we should talk.
You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?
Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.
Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! 
Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.
'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.
Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.
Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
-doo-n-doo--doo-doooo--
Aaaaa! 
Aaaaa!
Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.
