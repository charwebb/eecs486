Me? I would never abduct our son!

Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!

My pleasure, silly-buns.

I just want to make sure that you-

So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.

That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.

You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?

How about some shirazz, guys? 

That's great.

Oh my God!

Get out of here! 

Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!

Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.

...What was that last bit?

They're starting to remember.

Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.

Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. 

Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.

Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! 

Lalalalala...

Tweek!

Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. 

The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.

Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.

You too, Tweek!

Sit down and have some coffee, son.  Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about kids being abducted, and we thought we should talk.

Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo

We're sorry, Tweek!

That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him. "Under God" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  "Under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.

Atheism has definitely made our lives better.

Aaah

We can let them go, can we?

Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. 

You guys, you guys! I can do it.

Aaaaa! 

Why?

Oh?  I think I'll go with you.

Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.

How was school today, son?

'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.

Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.

Oh thanks, Sharon.

Guys! Sh, quiet everyone. 

Well... Good for you.

Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? 

That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.

If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.

'Oodleahah.

Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. 

Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?

He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.

Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
-doo-n-doo--doo-doooo--
Aaaaa! 
Aaaaa!

Did he hurt you, son?

Oh, hey Gerald. New car?

Richarrrrd!

Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! 

Where are you going?
