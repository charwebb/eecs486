We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.

Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.

It's the cloud of your memories, of your past.  Your childhood perhaps. What do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?

But it's broken.

There's some good men stuck in there.

I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.

Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?

Okay, great. How about we start with this? 

Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.

Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box.  Now how about this?  Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.

Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problem, Mr. Mackey?

Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.

Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.

We need ya Fred.

Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.

Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!

We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.

Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?

Oh no, really?

It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?

It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. 

What are you doing?!

Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.

Probably one of them in the dream.

We had a country to protect!

Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.

It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!

Ahhh, you're back, everyone! 

Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!

Wife and kids.

Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.

Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.

Because.

Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.

Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second.  Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... Now the cloud is near you. You... you reach out to it.

If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.

And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! 

Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this?  Broken toothbrush.

I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.

It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.

It's pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are.

Oh Jesus.

Yes, you are herding sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.

Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? 

It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.

What the hell is going on?!

There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.

Ah good, you're here.
