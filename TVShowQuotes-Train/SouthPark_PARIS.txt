Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small!
I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it!  I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.
Look at his wittle puff ball!  I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! 
Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here!  What the fuck is that?
Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little spent. I did a whole lot of partying last night with a LOT of different guys.  Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Gouth Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store! A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me! Stupid Spoiled Whore!  Have fun, girls. And remember to party, and be super-lame to everybody. G'Bye!  Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink!  Where's my dog?! 
What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car.  I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?
God, get me out of this hick town! What a bunch of rednecks!  Everybody's so fucking lame. Except for you, my little Tinkerbell. You love my vewy much, don't you? How much you wuv me? I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny, and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess. You're mine forever!  Whatever! Oh, hey, Kasey. Oh, another stupid store opening at some lame cowboy town.  Oh, it's so fucking stupid, this whole town stinks like cows.  I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!  They have the lamest stores, too.  I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend, I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo, either way it'll be totally boring.  Stupid.  Hagh.  I need to get wasted. I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes. Why is everybody so stupid anyway?  I flashed all these hicks with my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back!  You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! 
You don't even know what partying is, loser. 
Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo...  Wait! Wait, stop the car!  Stop the car, you fucking moron!  Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!
Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. 
Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!
Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it. 
Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already.
I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.
Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
There you are, Mr. Biggles!  Aw, I thought I'd lost you!  Promise you'll never leave me. 
To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?
What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much.  Oh my God, I'm so wasted!  The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out.
