[on phone] Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you?
Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?
Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here...
[Kevin rings bell at the front desk] Good morning.  How can I help you?
There is a cancellation fee for this, sir.
You  must be Mr. Malone.  One moment please.
Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.
Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months.
Um, I don't seem to have it, sir.
Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?
