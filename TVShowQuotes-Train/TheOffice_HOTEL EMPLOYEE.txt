Um, I don't seem to have it, sir.
Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?
Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months.
Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here...
Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?
Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.
[on phone] Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you?
There is a cancellation fee for this, sir.
[Kevin rings bell at the front desk] Good morning.  How can I help you?
[whispers to manager] Sir.  It's the man with the shoes.
