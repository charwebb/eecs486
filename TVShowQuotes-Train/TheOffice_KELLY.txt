Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
That looks, cool, where is that?
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
Bye. [Andy barks]
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
Ryan used me an object.
Have we met before?
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
Just leave me alone!
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
Okay, bye honey.
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Never marrying.
Yeah.
Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
Do you think I should diet?
She's so wonderful.
Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
Oh God. [takes off ring]
How about you Pam?
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
Yeah, thanks.
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Okay, role-playing time!
1, 2, 3!
She manipulates you.
Let go of me!
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
You told us we had to.
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
I can���t get down.
[laughing] I love you too.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Enjoy the snow losers.
I was a twelve year old bully.
Having fun.
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
I don't know.
Jim!
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
What'd you say h[bleep]?
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
I didn't do anything!
You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Is Brad okay?
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
Andy Bernard??
Stop squirming.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Nothing's going on.
Why?
Oh.
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
I do find that offensive, actually.
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
Hope she's OK.
Six.
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Damn girl! Your body!
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
I don't want to hit the big rock!
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Okay. [makes out with Darryl]
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Are you going to happy hour later?
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Yeah. It was.
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Oh my God, kill me!
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
And you're sorry.
Is Ryan going?
Yeah.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
I feel weird.
What?
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
I know but there was an emergency.
Like, an Indian Halloween?
Oh my God, when is it?
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
See? I wasn't lying.
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Everybody hates those endings!
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
How is this a pizza party?
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Now he's never gonna come.
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
And that, is how it's done.
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
So, how's your day been?
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
[mouth full of cake] Me too!
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
You chose this job over that job?
Why would he say that?
My resolution was to get more attention.
Are you moving back here?
[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
...that I thought you should know ...
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
You know, some place romantic and expensive.
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
Oh, good, that was from me.
Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Fine.
I guess.
Yo.
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
Yeah, where are your kids?
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Why not?
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Thanks, Michael.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
Did Michael get them for you?
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Mmhmm.
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Mm-hmm.
I thought you read these every week.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
I love it.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
Ask where he's from.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
He's not saying anything!
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.
Did you hear something?
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
Andy, that was just the ice.
[bang] Whoa.
[giggles] Thank you.
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
Oh it was?
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Thank you.
No problem.
Oh, from the insurance commercials!
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
Yeah, shut up Kevin.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
Do you think I'm a slut?
OK. Bring it on.
[in accent] Absolutely!
What?
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
[whispering] Come on!
Screw you.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
Hey, what's going on?
That's not that bad actually.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
No, he's a freak.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
I took the tags off already.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Pam?
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
[to Ryan] You're so cool.
Because I never forget anything.
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
I don't have any, assh***.
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
I thought they were kind of cute.
Oh, so I'm crazy now?
I don't understand.
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]
Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Oh, great.
No, seriously Pam, wake up.
What?
Oh.
No!
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
We're back together again baby.
Come on Scott, please? It's me.
Bye, Angela!
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Who's eating all these apples?
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
I love your tie, Michael.
Oh, art show!
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Hi David! [group hellos]
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
I think I'm gonna stay here.
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]
Sparkles...
Pitiful.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
It was you.
Don't even listen to them. They're so...
Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?
What?
Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
It's Eric and Megan.
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Yeah, but everyone else-
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
You really would?
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
You did? I wanna see the cake.
Who was that?
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
I do, I do. This isn't right.
Okay?
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
And...
Spicy Curry', what's that mean?
Good. Let���s go.
Wha���what's Dwight's mothers name.
Oh, me too.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
Was he still there?
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Do they still get paid?
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Blankets, what am I, five?
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
Hey! Is that his scarf?
Dwight, get out of my nook!
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Cake.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
It has almost no calories.
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
So, you're dumping Michael? Smart.
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
Hello, Ryan.
Dwight!
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Ooooh!
I just had the longest meeting.
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Um, customer service.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
Definitely some place you can swim.
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Ryan.
Can I be your bridesmaid?
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Guess whose boyfriend it is?
Yeah bitch.
What did I say?
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
Drake is your baby���s name?
Should I seduce him?
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Where?
Hi, Michael.
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Well then, what's the one true rumor?
Right, so?
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Damn it.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
[voice cracks] I'm so happy for you...
I will steal the iPod.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Stop yelling at me!
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
Oh, my god!
You look so handsome.
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
Hello.
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
I don't care. They can just vote.
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
What did yours say?
Why are you eating stem first?
[bleep] me!
Yep. [spreads tablecloth]
Sometimes my bangs cover it.
[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.
Why is it so tight?
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
I know, obsessed with me much?
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
You're so funny.
It's
She looks awful.
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Why is that?
Big mistake! Huge!'
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
I look
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
So you're dumping me?
Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
Mmm-hmm.
Well why don't you invite your friends?
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
I try not to think about it.
What happened? Is there a ring?
Oh! You scared me!
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
Have a seat, I'll write it down.
That���s a tablecloth.
Good one, Kev.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
He's rubbing his neck.
Decorating.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
What emails are you talking about?
This doesn't look good.
Screw you.
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
For you.  I'm with Darryl.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
[crying]
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
I am so cold.
Tu Bishvat!
Oh, baby.
A vacation.
We're screwed.
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Yes, I told everyone.
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
I don't get the reason for this party.
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
WHAT??
Second opinion on what?
It's about a family. A real-life family.
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Waaay too tight.
Pam, he's just not that into you.
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
[shakes her head no]
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
I invited him.
We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
But I--it's not right.
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
Cool.
It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
You look so pretty.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
The show's back on, what happened?
Mmhmm.
Who's Bob Hope?
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
Only three tickets.
It's true!
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
Who?
Take that! ��Not so pre-violent anymore!
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Well, I think I have that persona.
Which time?
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
You have to stop.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Ice Cream.
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
So you should be heading back to your desk.
That hotel, it looks so romantic.
Oh!
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Cool.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
I just told you.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
Is that traffic school?
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]
Oh yeah, she loves that headband.
Hi.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
[shaking head]
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
1... 2... 3
Yeah, he's weird.
Whoo!
On it.
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Uh huh. Hold me.
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Oh, can I come?
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
Yeah, it was a great deal.
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
OK.
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
No!
Oh my God what song was that?
What?!
All the time.
I know, right?  Probably a lot.
What?
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Hey.
So unnecessary.
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
I do.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
[gasps] I love it!
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
What! [cheers]
Just reiterating what you said to me.
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.
Try 'Jesus.'
Oh, my God. You scared me.
Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
Uh, thank you.
Oh, that is so good.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
I'm too excited to sleep.
It's a small office.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
Wow.
I hate it.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
We have a date!
Thank you. [Gabe mumbles]
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Not so much anymore.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
So where's the ring?
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
I'm dying!
Ugh, no that thing is
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Cool.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
No. I'm gonna count to 3.
Ryan, I changed my mind.
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
Sorry?
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Wait, Michael?
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
She's 23.
Okay. Bye, Toby.
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
Lulu from The Fifth Element.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
I mean that's a baseball term, right?
Who, what?
Thanks.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
Michael, it's time.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
We're like best friends now!
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Boring.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
No.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
I was kickin' it.
I wasn't going to interrupt.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Really?
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
We���re running off into the sunset.
I know.
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
You're such a ditz.
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Ryan?
That's all he wrote.
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
You're killing him, Michael!
Thank you, Dwight.
Yeah, what are you doing here?
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
Hell yeah.
It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
Hi, Michael.
What?!
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
Michael get to the good part.
Blow my brains out.
Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
Eww, what is that?
Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
I don't know if she was white.
This is a bowler-
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
That idea sucks.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
That'll work.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Why?
I get that. I get that.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
If you take it back, I'll scream.
I'm going to have some cake.
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
[texting] What song was it?
Hi-yah!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
What's going on?
[enters conference room]
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
Punch him, Toby!
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
For you maybe.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
I...
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Are you accusing me of something?
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Think you can handle this?
What are you referencing?
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
So, I was looking so hot...
I eat beef.
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]
Hey, Ryan!
Oh, god.
Is that a blow torch?!
That's Buddhist.
Yeah, it was.
Umm, see you later tonight.
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
But parody is always derivative.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
Sometimes.
Good luck Michael!
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
I was lying.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
I'll text you!
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Oh.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
What was that?
Nope.
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Andy, pick up the phone!
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Oh, my God...
But you're an accountant too.
Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
God, how many number nines did you order?
Cause it's like, really...
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
I'm okay!
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
I was raped.
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
Here you go.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
Because they acted all tough and everything...
No, I'm scared.
Give me that thing, I want to try.
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
What? I'm not Muslim!
Mmm hmm.
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Team U.S.A.!
Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly]
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Are you kidding me?
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Hey, guys.
Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Just put it in your pocket.
Oh my God, I'm so worried.
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Can't do what?
But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
