And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
God, how many number nines did you order?
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
So you should be heading back to your desk.
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
You always say that, and I almost never know.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
I don't get the reason for this party.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
Give me that thing, I want to try.
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
I don't understand what the big deal is.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
Can we just take those first two things?
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
I don't want to hit the big rock!
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
