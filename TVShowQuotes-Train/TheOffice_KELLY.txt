This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Give me that thing, I want to try.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
And that is what you call a meet cute.
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
You always say that, and I almost never know.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
Well, his heart was in the right place.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
I don't get the reason for this party.
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
God, how many number nines did you order?
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
So you should be heading back to your desk.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
