I wasn't going to interrupt.
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
I was a twelve year old bully.
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Okay, role-playing time!
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
So, you're dumping Michael? Smart.
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Not so much anymore.
Namaste.
She manipulates you.
That's Buddhist.
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
I just had the longest meeting.
You look so handsome.
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
1, 2, 3!
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
I do.
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Boring.
Damn girl! Your body!
Uh, thank you.
Why are you eating stem first?
Ooooh!
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
Wha���what's Dwight's mothers name.
Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
Cool.
Hey! Is that his scarf?
When Deangelo's around.
Oh God. [takes off ring]
I don't know.
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Good. And the dry cleaners?
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
Oh, me too.
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
She's so wonderful.
AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
What?
Um, customer service.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Hi David! [group hellos]
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
Right, so?
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
This point system is really insulting.
Sometimes.
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Have a seat, I'll write it down.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
We have a date!
[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
That���s a tablecloth.
What did yours say?
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
No, I'm scared.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
It has almost no calories.
Spicy Curry', what's that mean?
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
I try not to think about it.
I don't get the reason for this party.
Blow my brains out.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
Ryan.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
You know, some place romantic and expensive.
Mm-hmm.
You always say that, and I almost never know.
Cake.
What?
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
I never know when you're kidding.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
Oh my God, I'm so worried.
You chose this job over that job?
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Why?
Stop yelling at me!
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
[bang] Whoa.
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
Give me that thing, I want to try.
[shaking head] Weird.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
That hotel, it looks so romantic.
Hi-yah!
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Yeah.
Oh, God, please stop!
[voice cracks] I'm so happy for you...
Blankets, what am I, five?
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
So unnecessary.
I don't care. They can just vote.
Oh, baby.
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Is Ryan going?
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[mouth full of cake] Me too!
Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
Why is it so tight?
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
Oh.
I took the tags off already.
We're back together again baby.
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
It's a small office.
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
Ryan?
But you're an accountant too.
Drake is your baby���s name?
Good.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
Dwight, get out of my nook!
Come on Scott, please? It's me.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
Oh.
I'll text you!
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
I hate it.
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
Are you kidding me?
It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
[in accent] Absolutely!
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
So where's the ring?
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
Where?
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Ice Cream.
I will steal the iPod.
Definitely, definitely, Jim.
Hey.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
I do find that offensive, actually.
We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
Oh.
I am so cold.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
[Screams]
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
Can't do what?
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
I think I'm gonna stay here.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
I don't have any, assh***.
Thank you. [Gabe mumbles]
Only three tickets.
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Uh huh. Hold me.
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Who, what?
I invited him.
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
I love your tie, Michael.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
Try 'Jesus.'
No, he's a freak.
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Yeah, shut up Kevin.
Which time?
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
What did I say?
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Let go of me!
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
Are you going to happy hour later?
Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
Yeah, what are you doing here?
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
Yeah, it was.
Is that traffic school?
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Was he still there?
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Good. Let���s go.
Yeah, it was a great deal.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Me, too Oscar.
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
This is a bowler-
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?
Hey, guys.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
Oh, my god!
Who was that?
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Like, an Indian Halloween?
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Hope she's OK.
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Think you can handle this?
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Well that blows.
Can we speak privately about our relationship?
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
I know.
I feel weird.
Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly]
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
[shaking head]
Why not?
Andy, pick up the phone!
Wow.
Are you moving back here?
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
I was raped.
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Fine.
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
But parody is always derivative.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Okay, bye honey.
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
Okay?
Finn.
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Yeah bitch.
Take that! ��Not so pre-violent anymore!
The show's back on, what happened?
Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
Ugh, no that thing is
Hi.
You are so mean.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
Oh my God what song was that?
Oh yeah? Screw you too.
Josh Duhamel.
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
You really would?
It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
Mmm hmm.
He's rubbing his neck.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
Cool.
Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Team U.S.A.!
I'm dying!
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
You're such a ditz.
OK.
Enjoy the snow losers.
I thought you read these every week.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
What?
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
And that, is how it's done.
Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
I was lying.
You had carbs?  That's awful.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
Who's eating all these apples?
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Oh my God, when is it?
Hey, what's going on?
So you should be heading back to your desk.
Hi, Michael.
Michael get to the good part.
You prayed for this?
Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
Cool.
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Oh! You scared me!
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
Yeah.
And...
Oh, great.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Pitiful.
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
No!
Well, his heart was in the right place.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
I'm going to have some cake.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]
[texting] What song was it?
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Wait, Michael?
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
If you take it back, I'll scream.
Dwight: What are you doing?
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Oh it was?
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
OK. Bring it on.
You did? I wanna see the cake.
That's all he wrote.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Oh, from the insurance commercials!
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
How is this a pizza party?
You're killing him, Michael!
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
You told us we had to.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
I guess.
Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
[whispering] Come on!
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Second opinion on what?
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
[shakes her head no]
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
What drama?
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
Oh, god.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
What?!
Why would he say that?
Sometimes my bangs cover it.
We're screwed.
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
I know but there was an emergency.
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
See? I wasn't lying.
Thanks.
Just reiterating what you said to me.
[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
I don't understand.
OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
No problem.
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
For you maybe.
It's Eric and Megan.
Is Brad okay?
I get that. I get that.
Are you accusing me of something?
Thank you, Dwight.
What the hell is a mallard?
Nothing's going on.
Oh, art show!
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Jim!
I didn't do anything!
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
I'm too excited to sleep.
It's about a family. A real-life family.
What?
What?
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
You look so pretty.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
A lot. Black guys mostly.
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Do they still get paid?
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
I know, obsessed with me much?
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
No. I'm gonna count to 3.
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.
Lulu from The Fifth Element.
It's true!
I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
Dwight!
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Bye, Angela!
She's 23.
[gasps] I love it!
I was kickin' it.
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Pam?
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Did Michael get them for you?
She could be.
He's not saying anything!
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
Oh, that is so good.
Six.
What?!
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
Yes, I told everyone.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
Well, I think I have that persona.
Well then, what's the one true rumor?
Yeah, he's weird.
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
I just told you.
It's
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Michael, it's time.
[mumbles]
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Eww, what is that?
Oh, can I come?
She looks awful.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
Ryan used me an object.
Yeah, but everyone else-
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
What? I'm not Muslim!
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Bye. [Andy barks]
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
What are you referencing?
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
For you.  I'm with Darryl.
Stop squirming.
Can I be your bridesmaid?
It was you.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
That idea sucks.
What was that?
No.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
I hear whispering.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
Good luck Michael!
[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.
Oh, so I'm crazy now?
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
What's going on?
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Hey, Ryan!
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Oh, good, that was from me.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Oh!
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
What emails are you talking about?
God, how many number nines did you order?
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
Do you think I'm a slut?
Andy, that was just the ice.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Yeah, thanks.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Sorry?
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
Decorating.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Because they acted all tough and everything...
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
Just leave me alone!
No!
I'm okay!
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
I don't want to hit the big rock!
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
That'll work.
Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.
Who's Bob Hope?
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
Definitely some place you can swim.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
We���re running off into the sunset.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
I eat beef.
Andy Bernard??
I thought they were kind of cute.
Hi, Michael.
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
Well why don't you invite your friends?
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
Looks like salmon.
How about you Pam?
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Nope.
I...
Do you think I should diet?
Oh, my God...
I can���t get down.
Hello.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
1... 2... 3
What are you talking about?
I know, right?  Probably a lot.
Punch him, Toby!
Who?
What keeps your glasses on?
Really?
Yeah. It was.
We're like best friends now!
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
Yeah.
Because I never forget anything.
Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Can we just take those first two things?
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Why?
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
Ryan, I changed my mind.
And you're sorry.
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
I look
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
[to Ryan] You're so cool.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Umm, see you later tonight.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
All the time.
Big mistake! Huge!'
I don't know if she was white.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
...what else do people like?
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
What! [cheers]
Okay. Bye, Toby.
Sparkles...
Ryan, we're doing the dance!
This doesn't look good.
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
Mmm-hmm.
Isn't that like your third soda today?
Is that a blow torch?!
Cause it's like, really...
A vacation.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
So, how's your day been?
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
But I--it's not right.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Damn it.
...that I thought you should know ...
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Whoo!
Can I have a turkey burger?
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
You have to stop.
Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
Don't even listen to them. They're so...
You're so funny.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
Here you go.
Thanks, Michael.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
My resolution was to get more attention.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Yo.
I mean that's a baseball term, right?
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
Screw you.
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
[enters conference room]
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
Hell yeah.
Good one, Kev.
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Hello, Ryan.
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Oh yeah, she loves that headband.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
WHAT??
Everybody hates those endings!
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
Mmhmm.
[giggles] Thank you.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Waaay too tight.
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Ask where he's from.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
[crying]
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
Oh my God, kill me!
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Did you hear something?
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Yep. [spreads tablecloth]
So you're dumping me?
Pam, he's just not that into you.
