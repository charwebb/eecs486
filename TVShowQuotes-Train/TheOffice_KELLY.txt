See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
God, how many number nines did you order?
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
Give me that thing, I want to try.
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
I don't want to hit the big rock!
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
I don't get the reason for this party.
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
You always say that, and I almost never know.
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
Can we just take those first two things?
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
So you should be heading back to your desk.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
