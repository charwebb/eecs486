Well, his heart was in the right place.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
I don't get the reason for this party.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
You always say that, and I almost never know.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Can we just take those first two things?
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Give me that thing, I want to try.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
God, how many number nines did you order?
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
...and you call me, to calm you down...
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
So you should be heading back to your desk.
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
I don't understand what the big deal is.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
I don't want to hit the big rock!
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
