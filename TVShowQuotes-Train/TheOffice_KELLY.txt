Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
You always say that, and I almost never know.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
I don't get the reason for this party.
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Give me that thing, I want to try.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
So you should be heading back to your desk.
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
God, how many number nines did you order?
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Can we just take those first two things?
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
This is a fast food receipt from April.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
I don't want to hit the big rock!
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
