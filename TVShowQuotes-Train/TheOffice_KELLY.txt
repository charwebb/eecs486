Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]
Hey! Is that his scarf?
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Screw you.
So where's the ring?
[giggles] Thank you.
Cool.
That looks, cool, where is that?
Oh.
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
It's about a family. A real-life family.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
I try not to think about it.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
Hell yeah.
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
She manipulates you.
Oh, so I'm crazy now?
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
Oh!
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
That's Buddhist.
Who, what?
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Well then, what's the one true rumor?
See? I wasn't lying.
Thank you.
Hello, Ryan.
Good one, Kev.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
That was really cool. [they make out]
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
[enters conference room]
I do.
OK. Bring it on.
Are you moving back here?
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
Namaste.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
Thank you, Dwight.
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
You are so mean.
No!
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
What?
Definitely some place you can swim.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Second opinion on what?
I guess.
Oh, great.
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
You know, some place romantic and expensive.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Blow my brains out.
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
It was you.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
Oh it was?
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.
For you.  I'm with Darryl.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
She could be.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Oh, baby.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
[laughing] I love you too.
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
[bleep] me!
Why?
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Hi.
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
I thought you read these every week.
What happened? Is there a ring?
Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
Yeah.
Andy Bernard??
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
That's all he wrote.
Yeah.
No, I'm scared.
Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
She's so wonderful.
Whoo!
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
Ask where he's from.
I hate it.
So, you're dumping Michael? Smart.
Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Team U.S.A.!
Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Yeah. It was.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Well why don't you invite your friends?
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
We���re running off into the sunset.
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Thanks, Michael.
Oh, my God. You scared me.
A vacation.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
Oh, my God...
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
I feel weird.
Thank you. [Gabe mumbles]
I don't have any, assh***.
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
Josh Duhamel.
Cool.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
I don't care. They can just vote.
Nope.
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
It's
Should I seduce him?
I'm going to have some cake.
Damn it.
Oh.
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Nothing's going on.
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
I don't know if she was white.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
Drake is your baby���s name?
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Lulu from The Fifth Element.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Good. Let���s go.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
Why is it so tight?
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
Looks like salmon.
Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
Rachel.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
Dwight!
Who's eating all these apples?
It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Tu Bishvat!
Is that traffic school?
What are you talking about?
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
Right, so?
Everybody hates those endings!
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
I'm okay!
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Okay, bye honey.
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
This is a bowler-
What's going on?
Michael get to the good part.
I can���t get down.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
Oh yeah, she loves that headband.
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Is Brad okay?
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
I thought they were kind of cute.
Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
What?
For you maybe.
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
Pitiful.
Have a seat, I'll write it down.
I will steal the iPod.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Was he still there?
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
Mmhmm.
Can we just take those first two things?
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
I'm too excited to sleep.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
Yeah, he's weird.
So you should be heading back to your desk.
I do find that offensive, actually.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Ugh, no that thing is
But parody is always derivative.
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
It's Eric and Megan.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Hey.
Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?
[mumbles]
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Can I have a turkey burger?
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
This doesn't look good.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
Oh, god.
Only three tickets.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
If you take it back, I'll scream.
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
What drama?
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
[whispering] Come on!
Give me that thing, I want to try.
...what else do people like?
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
So, I was looking so hot...
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
Which time?
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
Ryan?
Because they acted all tough and everything...
On it.
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
How about you Pam?
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
Who was that?
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
Oh, can I come?
[texting] What song was it?
My resolution was to get more attention.
What?
What the hell is a mallard?
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
Okay, role-playing time!
Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
Punch him, Toby!
But you're an accountant too.
[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
[shakes her head no]
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
How is this a pizza party?
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Big mistake! Huge!'
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Oh, from the insurance commercials!
Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
Having fun.
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Oh, me too.
OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]
Bye, Angela!
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Can I be your bridesmaid?
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
Yeah.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
Mmhmm.
God, how many number nines did you order?
What was that?
That'll work.
But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Yeah, what are you doing here?
Boring.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
Now he's never gonna come.
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
[to Ryan] You're so cool.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Oh my God, when is it?
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Decorating.
And...
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
Don't even listen to them. They're so...
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
No.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Hey, guys.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
I was raped.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
Good luck Michael!
Okay?
I hear whispering.
That idea sucks.
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
Sparkles...
The show's back on, what happened?
I was lying.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
We have a date!
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Dwight, get out of my nook!
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
He's rubbing his neck.
Jim!
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
You're such a ditz.
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
What did I say?
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
Me, too Oscar.
I know.
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
I think I'm gonna stay here.
I do, I do. This isn't right.
Oh my God, I'm so worried.
Just put it in your pocket.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
No!
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Andy, that was just the ice.
Why?
I love it.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Cause it's like, really...
Here you go.
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Eww, what is that?
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Where?
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
Guess whose boyfriend it is?
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
Thanks.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Ryan used me an object.
We're screwed.
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
I...
So you're dumping me?
That���s a tablecloth.
[shaking head]
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
Uh, thank you.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
You're killing him, Michael!
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
[voice cracks] I'm so happy for you...
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
What are you referencing?
Do they still get paid?
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
And you're sorry.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
Wha���what's Dwight's mothers name.
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
Mm-hmm.
Michael, it's time.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Did you hear something?
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Think you can handle this?
Just leave me alone!
OK.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
Um, customer service.
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
What?
Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
Good.
Oh, that is so good.
1... 2... 3
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
So, how's your day been?
You have to stop.
Ooooh!
You always say that, and I almost never know.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Wow.
I don't understand.
Yeah, but everyone else-
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
I never know when you're kidding.
Oh.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Do you think I should diet?
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Okay. Bye, Toby.
Waaay too tight.
Why not?
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Hey, what's going on?
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
Well, I think I have that persona.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
[in accent] Absolutely!
That's not that bad actually.
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
This point system is really insulting.
Sorry?
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
[bang] Whoa.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
What?
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
You had carbs?  That's awful.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Let go of me!
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Oh my God, kill me!
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Why are you eating stem first?
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
Finn.
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
I wasn't going to interrupt.
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
Wait, Michael?
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Screw you.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Fine.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
You look so pretty.
What'd you say h[bleep]?
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
Are you kidding me?
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Oh my God what song was that?
Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Yeah, shut up Kevin.
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
What?!
Yeah, where are your kids?
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
I invited him.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
Pam?
Dwight: What are you doing?
I just had the longest meeting.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
We're like best friends now!
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
I know, obsessed with me much?
Andy, pick up the phone!
No problem.
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
I know, right?  Probably a lot.
No, seriously Pam, wake up.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
Oh, good, that was from me.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
Take that! ��Not so pre-violent anymore!
Cake.
Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.
Stop yelling at me!
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
[gasps] I love it!
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
You look so handsome.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Is Ryan going?
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
WHAT??
Definitely, definitely, Jim.
Oh, my god!
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Why would he say that?
Ryan, we're doing the dance!
Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
So unnecessary.
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
Yeah, it was a great deal.
Who's Bob Hope?
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
[crying]
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
What? I'm not Muslim!
I don't want to hit the big rock!
You're so funny.
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
[Screams]
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
I eat beef.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Yeah.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Oh! You scared me!
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
I get that. I get that.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Ryan, I changed my mind.
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
I just told you.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Spicy Curry', what's that mean?
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
[shaking head] Weird.
Six.
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Okay. [makes out with Darryl]
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
I took the tags off already.
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
I'll text you!
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
I was kickin' it.
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
That hotel, it looks so romantic.
1, 2, 3!
Did Michael get them for you?
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Uh huh. Hold me.
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
Hi David! [group hellos]
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Have we met before?
It's true!
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
Are you accusing me of something?
Just reiterating what you said to me.
Good. And the dry cleaners?
She's 23.
Really?
Who?
I was a twelve year old bully.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
Ice Cream.
[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!
What! [cheers]
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
Like, an Indian Halloween?
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Oh, God, please stop!
What did yours say?
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
You prayed for this?
I love your tie, Michael.
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
Why is that?
Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
Hey, Ryan!
Yep. [spreads tablecloth]
Stop squirming.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
She looks awful.
And that, is how it's done.
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
All the time.
It has almost no calories.
Yeah, it was.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
What keeps your glasses on?
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
I mean that's a baseball term, right?
Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
Hi, Michael.
Hope she's OK.
Blankets, what am I, five?
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Because I never forget anything.
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
Damn girl! Your body!
Isn't that like your third soda today?
Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm dying!
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Hello.
Sometimes my bangs cover it.
Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly]
I am so cold.
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
What?
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Sometimes.
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
No, he's a freak.
Yeah, thanks.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
You really would?
I know but there was an emergency.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
When Deangelo's around.
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Well, his heart was in the right place.
What?!
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
Can't do what?
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
Come on Scott, please? It's me.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
No. I'm gonna count to 3.
