Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee. 
GOODD!  OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS! 
Oh—I'm sorry little girl.  But you still can't get on.  You have to take the special ed bus.
Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot. 
I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus.
HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
I can't help but feel that I've forgotten somethin'.
