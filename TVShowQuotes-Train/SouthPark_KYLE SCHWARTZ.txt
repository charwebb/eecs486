Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't. 
Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice.
Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever. 
If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
