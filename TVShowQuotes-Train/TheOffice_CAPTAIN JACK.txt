All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?
Yeah! All right. All right. That was awesome. All right, looks like the guitar player's gonna take a little break. So this'd be a great time to head on over to the taco bar. All right.
We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!
Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.
This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.
Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.
I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.
Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...
Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?
Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!
Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.
Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?
All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!
