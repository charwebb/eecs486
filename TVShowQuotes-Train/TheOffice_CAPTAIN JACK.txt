Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?
I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.
Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.
Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?
Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.
All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!
They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.
Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!
Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.
Yeah! All right. All right. That was awesome. All right, looks like the guitar player's gonna take a little break. So this'd be a great time to head on over to the taco bar. All right.
Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?
We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!
