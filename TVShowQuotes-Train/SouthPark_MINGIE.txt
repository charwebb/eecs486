I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!

Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!

I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.

She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!

'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!

There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!

We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.

What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!

Gary, what's, what's wrong?

Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. 

Not unless she gets fired.

All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! 

Aw you stupid twit!!

I'm warnin' you!

Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!

I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.

I'm 'ere, Gary!

She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.

Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary!  I'm comin' to see ya!

I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! 

Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!

What'd 'e say?

Oh keep your head, Gary.

Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?

Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!

Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!

Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.

Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!

He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this:

Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.

Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!

Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.

Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!

We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.

Try to hang on, Gary!

Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!

No... Oh no!

Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.

Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!

Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.

Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! 

What's this? What's she doin'?

If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!

That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.

Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?

Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.

'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!
