There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!
Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!
I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! 
What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!
Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!
Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!
That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.
'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?
'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!
Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.
If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!
Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!
I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!
He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this:
Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! 
Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!
We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.
Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!
Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. 
She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!
Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.
All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! 
Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!
I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.
She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.
We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
