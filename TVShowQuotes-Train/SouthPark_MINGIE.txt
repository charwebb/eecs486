Not unless she gets fired.

No turnin' back now, Gary.

Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.

Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!

Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?

Aw you stupid twit!!

I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! 

Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! 

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!

If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!

Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.

Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.

Oh keep your head, Gary.

All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! 

Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.

Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?

We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.

Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!

Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.

I'm 'ere, Gary!

Try to hang on, Gary!

I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.

Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!

Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!

Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?

Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!

Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!

Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. 

I'm warnin' you!

She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.

What'd 'e say?

There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!

She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!

I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.

No... Oh no!

What's this? What's she doin'?

We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.

Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!

Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!

'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.

Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!

I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!

Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.

He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this:

It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!

Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!

'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!

That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.
