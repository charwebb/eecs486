I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!
That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.
If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!
'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!
He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this:
Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!
Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!
Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.
Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!
All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! 
What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!
There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!
She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.
Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.
I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.
I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! 
Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!
Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary!  I'm comin' to see ya!
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!
'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.
Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!
We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!
Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!
Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
