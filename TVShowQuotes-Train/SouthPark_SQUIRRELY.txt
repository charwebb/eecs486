There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.
He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. 
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
