There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. 
He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.
You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
