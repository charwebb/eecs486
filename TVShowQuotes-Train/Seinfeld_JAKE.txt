What?
Where did you get those?
Where did you get those?
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
I can't tell you that.
Goodnight!
Tell me.
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
(notices glasses) Where did you get those?
What are you talking about?
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
Ooh...
You're saying you didn't say hi.
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
Then when did you get those?
She did.
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
You still like me, don't you?
Well, you notice anything?
Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
You never said hi?
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
What is it?
So?
No thanks.
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
