Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
You never said hi?
Ooh...
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
No thanks.
Where did you get those?
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
(notices glasses) Where did you get those?
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Tell me.
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
I would like to be alone now, please.
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
So?
Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Goodnight!
Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
What are you talking about?
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
She did.
Then when did you get those?
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
Well, you notice anything?
You're saying you didn't say hi.
You still like me, don't you?
What's so curious about it?
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
What is it?
I can't tell you that.
What?
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
