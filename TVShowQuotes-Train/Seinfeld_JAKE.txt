Where did you get those?
Ooh...
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
Tell me.
Where did you get those?
She did.
You're saying you didn't say hi.
What is it?
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
You never said hi?
I can't tell you that.
You still like me, don't you?
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
What are you talking about?
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
I would like to be alone now, please.
No thanks.
So?
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
Well, you notice anything?
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
(notices glasses) Where did you get those?
What?
(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
Goodnight!
