Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
