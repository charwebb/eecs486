Ooh...
You're saying you didn't say hi.
You still like me, don't you?
What is it?
What?
(notices glasses) Where did you get those?
Well, you notice anything?
(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!
So?
Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
I would like to be alone now, please.
Where did you get those?
You never said hi?
Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
What are you talking about?
Where did you get those?
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
What's so curious about it?
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
Tell me.
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
No thanks.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
She did.
