Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
I would like to be alone now, please.
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
