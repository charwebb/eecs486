Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt.
Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.
Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?
Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)
I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.
(angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!?
Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?
This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.
(to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?
He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house.
