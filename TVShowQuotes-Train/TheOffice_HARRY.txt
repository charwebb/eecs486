Anyway, Robert���s gonna run this company into the ground, so��� We won���t be doing this in six months.
Is it just me or is our boss a freakin��� weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I���m gonna get some air.
Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse ���
Robert California. What a surprise you���re here in Scranton.
Robert���s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don���t think we were doing that.
You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one���s that guy?
So what would you do if you weren���t selling paper?
They���re New York. We���re New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That���s the way it���s always been.
I���d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like��� a plane. One sale, I���m out.
No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
You know, your partner���s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
Stay out of my state. It���s in your best interest to stay out of my state.
So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Where do you get off crossing state lines?
