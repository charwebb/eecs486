So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.
It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.
So you can relate?
Why?
I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)
Oh, hi Jerry.
Really.
Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)
Yes! How did you know?
He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
Good. How you doin'?
Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.
Oh, that's o.k.
Yes, that's true.
A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?
Well, a lot of women are having them done.
Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
I hear that's how she died.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
Thursday night.
I was just leaving.
What do you tell them?
Yes.
Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
What if it's an emergency?
Yeah...
O.K....(they switch places.)
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
