Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
Why?
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?
So you can relate?
Good. How you doin'?
We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.
Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.
What do you tell them?
Yes, that's true.
He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
Oh, hi Jerry.
Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
Really.
Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
Oh, that's o.k.
I hear that's how she died.
Well, a lot of women are having them done.
Yeah...
I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)
I was just leaving.
I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)
Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)
Yes.
Yes! How did you know?
Thursday night.
What if it's an emergency?
Yeah.
So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.
A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
O.K....(they switch places.)
