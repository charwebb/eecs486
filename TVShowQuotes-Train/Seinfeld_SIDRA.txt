A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)
Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)
Well, a lot of women are having them done.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.
Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.
He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.
