He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?
Well, a lot of women are having them done.
A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)
Good. How you doin'?
So you can relate?
Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
Come on, Jackie. Let's go.
Oh, that's o.k.
Yeah.
O.K....(they switch places.)
It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.
Thursday night.
Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.
Yes, that's true.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
What if it's an emergency?
Why?
What do you tell them?
We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.
Yes.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
I hear that's how she died.
Yes.
Yes! How did you know?
I was just leaving.
I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)
So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.
