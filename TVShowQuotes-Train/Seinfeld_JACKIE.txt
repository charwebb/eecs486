And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
No top? She didn't have a top on?
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!
Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
