Then what happened?
Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
Attempted murder? Of whom?
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
No top? She didn't have a top on?
Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!
Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?
Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?
No, no, no, no!
Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
Hm Hm. You take a sip?
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
No further questions, your honor.
Like taking candy from a baby.
Your face is my case.
I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
No money? Then what'd we get?
I said out.
(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
Jackie.
You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
So. Then what happened?
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
Could you repeat that?
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
Was there a top on it?
Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
Half milk, half coffee?
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
Oh no.
How much?
The who?
Free coffee?
