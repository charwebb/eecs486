Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
Jackie.
Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
Could you repeat that?
No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
I said out.
Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
Like taking candy from a baby.
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
No money? Then what'd we get?
Your face is my case.
I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
Then what happened?
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
Half milk, half coffee?
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
No top? She didn't have a top on?
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
Was there a top on it?
Hm Hm. You take a sip?
You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
Oh no.
I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
So. Then what happened?
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
Attempted murder? Of whom?
So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
How much?
Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!
And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
Free coffee?
Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?
Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
No further questions, your honor.
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?
