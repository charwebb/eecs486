So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
Was there a top on it?
I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
No top? She didn't have a top on?
Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
Your face is my case.
Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
How much?
I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
Free coffee?
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
No further questions, your honor.
Attempted murder? Of whom?
So. Then what happened?
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
No money? Then what'd we get?
The who?
Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
Could you repeat that?
Oh no.
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
No, no, no, no!
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
Half milk, half coffee?
Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
Hm Hm. You take a sip?
And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
I said out.
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
Like taking candy from a baby.
