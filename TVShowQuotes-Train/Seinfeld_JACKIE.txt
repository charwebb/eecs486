Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
No top? She didn't have a top on?
(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!
Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
