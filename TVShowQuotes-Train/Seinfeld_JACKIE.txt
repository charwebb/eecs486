Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
No top? She didn't have a top on?
Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
