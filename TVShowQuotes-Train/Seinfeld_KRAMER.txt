Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
She didn't have any?
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
Pine is good.
Seattle, yeah!
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
Why, what's the difference?
Let me see.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
Oh, uh, well - okay.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
All right, get off at the next exit.
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
Yeah, right...
Hmm.
He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
No, I want to show you.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
Oh, thank you.
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.

Well, that's how cats do it.

Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
Oh, yeah?
OK, OK-
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
Yeah. That's strange.
You always tell it ..
Na, I am down
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
What happened here?
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
No. That's bush league.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
oh... (goes to the bedroom)
Ooh, I like that.
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!
Alright, alright...
Rusty! Rusty!
Big! Big!
You know I'm in that movie?
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
No, lets go to the couch...
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
Oh, giddyup. Yeah.
Why, why? Why does she get it?
Alright, so you're gonna look after it?
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
What would be the point in taking the water?
Can you give him a cookie?
Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
These are great seats huh?
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
Oh. Oh, George.
You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
(shrill) What!?
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Genderson's.
Hey.
Pzzzt. No.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
Well, I'm gonna type it up.
Yeah. That's Rusty.
Why? What wa?
Right.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
"You've got something between your teeth"
I saw the whole thing!
Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?
Well at least there's no traffic.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
Where?
But she wants the shoes.
I don't know.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.
What's an extremity?
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
Danke schoen, my little dumplings.
Its over four hundred?
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
All right, let's go.
Well, you're not reading it now.
I told you.
Can't hear a thing.
Which one?
All right, who's down there?
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
It'll take you ten seconds.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
(Wiggling and floppin) Pull Down
I want to talk to Calvin.
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
I wanna see it.
Is there a tree?
Y'hello.
Hey what again?
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
What, did they kick you out too?
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
Poise. Poise!
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
Yeah, maybe not technically, but
Well, I know what they feel like.
I'm at the airport.
What guy?
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
[In Newman's ear] Make us.
This truck is dying. We're losing him.
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.
Get outta here.
I only got hundreds.
Hey.
well she says Jane
They gave them all to Goodwill.
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
Hey.
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
I don't know.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
It is very obtrusive.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
"Yeah"
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)
Yeah!
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Yeah. What dog?
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
Right.
(shouts to the telephone) Hi George!
What dog?
Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst...
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.
(opening a card) Oh, a check.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
Hmm.
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
I can't taste this.
Wait, wait, wait...
(Interested) That's perfect.
Hey, McNab!
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.
You want to sit here?
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
Yeah... I do great, yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Are they war veterans?
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Really?
Wet and wild.
Is that a problem?
Yeah, merry Christmas.
You better believe it.
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
Alright, what did you do to Poppie?
Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
All right
Hey, Seinfelds!
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
Well, we're not very close.
I would advise against that.
Those people, listen to yourself.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
What'd you get for it?
Just drive.
what about?
Oh, well I have many associates.
Huckleberry.
Oh, hey.
Hey, buddy!
Well, I tell time by the sun.
Huh! You make a higher roof.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
Come on, Larry. You know me.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Let's go.
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
Oh, everybody's your type.
What's going on?
Break up with her
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Thank you.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.
Hello, twelve dollars.
Oh yeah, I?m selling.
(does a double take) It's too busy
(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.
Anything new with that guy on drugs?
hey, you're hungry? Monk's?
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.
I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Oowe (Kramer noise -- hes eating something)
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Youre flesh and blood.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
If only I could say things like that around her.
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
I'll just squeeze in...
I'm here to talk about the ocean.
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Oh here we go--
Well, it's my final offer.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
Eh!
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Good for you.
Oooow! He's biting me!
Hi Todd.
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
C'mon Jerry!
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
Oh, you better believe it.
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
So now he wants her more than ever!
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Hey.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
What tonight?
Well, you won't regret it.
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
Well, he didn't say (leaves).
[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...
well it just doesn't sit well.
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
Uh-huh.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
The pharmacy's still open.
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
Yeah, so?
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
Are too.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
maana I'm doing nada
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
Jerry too, of course.
Well, I'm not an idiot.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
But wasn't that taken off the market?
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
I'll go.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
Yeah. How'd it go?
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
I may have to drive that place out of business.
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
Well, I'm a poppa.
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
Oh bold and beautiful.
All right, all right.
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
Oh, Mama.
yeah yeah
(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
May I..( pointing her food)
[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
Movie?
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
I lost my balance.
Gu-gu- cada-
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
Oh, come on!
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
...sluggish.
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
Are you through?
It's Kramer!
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Yeah, so whats the problem?
What?
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Look at this place. It's huge...
Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
I thought we had a deal?
Yeah, youre the punk Im looking for!
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
Maybe I will.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
Lets see what Jerry has to eat.
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
You wanna go see him?
Oh, he's a dunker.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
Apparently.
Yes!
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
Some nut in a clown suit!
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
I say we get him.
Hey.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
No, no, I'm off that.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.
Uh.
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.
-ca.
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.
I can't believe I didn't see it.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Sure do!
Cosmo Kramer.
Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.
Like the big toe captain..
That's right.
I tell you.
Whoa, whoa!!
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
Well, I gotta do somethin'.
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
I need the yield sign.
If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
I like mangos.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
What happened there?
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?
(Pleading) I was all dirty!
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
All right it's done.
Cmon, George. I saw it first.
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
That kid is gonna be all right.
Hey, what's going on?
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
"... with a broom, cleaning up."
So she works at the zoo?
I said how come it's takin' so long?
Use a belt.
No, you told me not to!
Yeah--
Huh?
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
Yeah (quietly)
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
Talk to me.
Ohhh!
Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Hey.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
I told ya.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
No, no. No doctors.
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
They got you too?
Jerry, if the man is in pain...
Well, where the meat goes?
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
Okay...yea well uh start with me.
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
Alright.
Seventy -five bucks a month!
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Oh?
Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
What?
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Here's your money.
(Shrugging Jerry off) Nah.
Yes!
Awe check it out.
Gladly.
Oh, I, I need a pen.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
All right, all right, come on, now.
(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.
My name's Kramer.
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.
Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
(going after Toby) Toby! Toby!
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
Well, I guess I just assumed.
Cause Im getting rid of it.
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
Oh.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
(to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
Oh, that's right.
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
Well then, what did you do next?
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
Oh, boy.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
All right, c'mon, let's go again.
Well, why not?
Its good to have you back, Stan.
I am baking a pie!
Which one?
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Well, thank you.
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
(shuts door) "Bailing"?
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
They're all looking up.
Yeah.
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
C'mon it's my turn.
Oh, yes.
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Hey.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
I'm in here. How's it going.
Right here at the mall.
You got that right!
No, no, I would turn you in.
Cubed.
Yes I am.
What's so funny? ... wha?
Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
All right, I'll take Julie.
Hey, George what are you doing here?
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
Well, yeah.
He's a happy camper huh?
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
(laughing) He he, yeah.
Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
What?
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Oh yeah! It's you!
I don't know...
No, it's just too much.
Oh?
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
I'm dizzy.
The monkey.
So, what do you think? Does this work?
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Mornin'.
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
You better get the door.
I'm in. Let's go for it.
(points) Digidi.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
Sure you do.
Well I won them anyway.
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
Really.
Oh, yeah.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Don't you get tired of following rules?
Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
He thinks you're a phony.
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
I'll be down in a minute.
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
Sure you have.
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Hi. How are you?
So, you sleep in separate beds.
Hey, you got a hammer?
(stops Mickey) Alright, come on.
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
I thought I heard you.
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
I dig.
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
???
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
What is what?
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
But I want to--
Who?
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
"So... Did you take a look?"
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
Uh huh. Your back hurt?
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Well, yeah.
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
Whoh!
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
(interested) Well, how do you do?
Feel it.
Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
Oh now you don't want my business.
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
What are they doing here?
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
Well, b -- it was stolen.
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Why?
Jerry he's a conductor.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
So!
Mmm... Nice wallet.
Yeah.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
I thought you took the test.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
Well that's a burgeoning continent.
Huh?
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
Because Im a pod?
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Well, don't look at me.
No, I got dibs!
(shouts) Hey, peanuts!
Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)
What, she's been away?
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
Huh?
Aahh, this looks familiar
Got any Double Crunch?
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
Well did you mention my name?
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
Well, can you call him an ambulance?
Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
(whimper) Jerry?
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
O'Brien.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
Hello, there.
HELLO!
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
"BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING."
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
Any word from Nana?
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
got problems Jerry.
What?!
What?
Well, that's classified.
Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
Hey! JoJo!
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
Oh yeah, you betcha.
Uh-oh. You're a john.
Newman died?
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Uh, no.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Will you relax?!
Wha?
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.
Ooh, cereal bowls.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
Yei-
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
No, man! Not the gas!
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
We played Backgammon in the nude.
Yeah, yeah..
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
Woah, you didn't like her?
He jumped.
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Why don't ya' leave?
Yah-hey.
what about the driver?
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
(shivering) I don't know.
Ms. Welch.
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
Maybe that's what he's got.
Mansiere?
It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
Jerry. Hey Jerry?
Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose.
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
"What? You're crazy."
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
Brought my phone.
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
well hello Jane
No, Julie. She's the one.
I got time.
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
What's the matter with him?
Right.
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
She says she wants those shoes.
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
Hello.
What's the problem?
Good question.
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
Do you have a woman?
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
"So, you're heading home?"
Jerry, I'll take care of it.
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
Well I suppose the children do.
(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
You killed them, didn't you?
Oh. Cotton Dockers!
Uh, you need any help, or..?
(quietly) Um-hm.
Well it's muffin stumps
From pain, will come pleasure.
Well...
Ive got the Kavorka Jerry.
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
Yeah.
Why are we slowing down?
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Yea, last night.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
Hey. New jacket?
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
Remember I told you about the bank?
Yes, yes! You said it!
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
Right here. (Elaine enters)
My god, you're rich.
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
he asked me
I didn't even know they were defective.
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
Uh-huh.
(suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)
Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
So, so what do you want me to do?
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
Yeah.
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
(lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.
Don't...
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
"What kind?"
I've made an important life decision.
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
You're wasting your life.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Cat fight?
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
Yep yep yep.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
(makes his pop sound) There you go.
How much?
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
Are you through?
Hey, our meat problems are solved.
T-t-t-t...
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
Jerry, that's in Sweden.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Okay.
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
Kramer.
Uh huh
NNNN-Giddy-up!
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
(pointing) You can go over here.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
"Yeah!!!"
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
Well, what's the matter?
I'm gonna eat that later.
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
All right, everybody! I'm back!
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
Hello.
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
He's the *phone* man!
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
All right, lets go.
The *beach*!
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
Yeah, so?
For you he would.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Oh, hey.
So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?
Exclamation point.
What?
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
Just show me the cheque, c'mon.
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
I don't wanna go back on there!
He begged me.
Excellent question.
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
Potato man!
Power, man. Power.
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
(Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
Why would you think I would invite him?
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
No? That's good.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Yeah, put these glasses on.
What's that guy's last name again?
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
It's over!
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
Oh, hey!
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
Relax, Silvio.
Uh, no thanks.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
(to George) Yeah!
(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
I'm taking the board with me.
Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
Me?
They just write it off.
You're moving to California?
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
The name on the boat. Look at it.
Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
Yes, that's true.
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Fix what?
Forty-eight.
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?
What about a big sponge?
I knew you would.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
Well, they're slim-fit.
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Confront Jerry? I can't.
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
Over three hundred?
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
Wha-- Oh, hey.
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
Hey!
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
Yeah, I'm an extra.
They're ladies' glasses.
Yeah.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Hey, what's going on?
Dont you know what that does to suede?
For what?
Hey buddy.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
So what?
Where do I know that guy from?
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
Hal, .. uh Langerhans.
Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?
Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
Those kids look pretty disappointed.
Now what is Executive?
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
Uh.. that's right.
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
But that's not Hello.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
(off screen) Outta My Way!
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
Serenity now, serenity now...
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
P B and J's. What d'you think?
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
h-Yeah...
(emotionally) She's deep.
Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.
Ah!
Look how dark it's gettin' already.
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
Hey!
Pass the cream.
(To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Hey.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
Ya.
Nothing Nothing.
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
I know how to handle these psychotics.
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Woah, Nelson!
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
No, I didn't see him.
Yeah. (He exits)
Yeah.
What are you doing to yourself?
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
How you doing?
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
Not really.
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
What's up?
No. No It's Lily
Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?
Yeah!
Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
Well, it's not really gold.
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Levels.
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
Yea.
You gotta go.
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
It was easy the last time.
I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
"Hey!"
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
It's pronounced thermometer.
Hey!
You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.
You got anything on the horizon?
What's going on?
Yeah! Ha ha.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
[thinks for a while]
What, they don't like me?
Hey there.
Let me see you do it.
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
No, I dunno how much duty is.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
"(gasp_)......Kom Pau........"
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
Well, that's a little strange.
She was probably joking.
Aaaaah.
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
yeah
Ah, Yeah. uh...
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
Excuse me.
Roger that.
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
I got a line in the movie!
Well, you can get 'em back.
Want some mango?
Ooh! !Dios mio!
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha.
Look away, I'm hideous.
Yeah.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
So, how you feeling?
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
Oh, hey.
I, I saw her naked.
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
When does it start?
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
Oh I'll take these.
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
Why, what...?
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
What about Sundays and holidays?
Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Did you see that guy?
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
This is the best way to go!
Where? Where?
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
I don't care, whatever.
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
I'll take it.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
Gimme your credit card.
Jerry, where have you been?
C'mon.
I think so too.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
Yeah.
A dry-cleaning bill for what?
A kidney stone.
We are talking.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
What is that, hickory?
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
No chance in hell!
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
Woah, that's quite a honk!
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
I get that too. (exits)
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
YEA!
Hello?
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?
Shell-shocked?
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
There are no delicatessens under Communism.
You know, I think you're jealous.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
I've had it with 'em.
I don't believe this.
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
Where's Jerry?
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
That's right.
I'm watching your door.
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
Hey
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
How could you?
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
Yeah?
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
Yeah.
Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Look out below!!
What do you mean?
Who?
We're making sausages.
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!
Ow
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
Yeah, yeah.
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Because we're blind to their tyranny.
Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Hey.
That's NBC.
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
Oh, so he took you back.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
Encounter shiatsu.
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
Oh, he ran away.
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
Oughh!
You know, I faked it.
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
Ah, no, that's not in the budget.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
What am I gonna say?
I live for Merlot.
Me?
(Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
You gotta come through with the hips first.
Yeah, alright...
(quietly) Hey, Jerry.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
You get to make your own pie!
What puddle?
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
I got it at Joes.
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Yeah, yeah, I know him.
Unbelievable.
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
Can I get in on that?
It was about 1200 bucks.
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
Well, you're not checked at on it.
But you haven't seen..
Let me tell it ..
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
(not convincing) Uh, yeah.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
Liked me.
Bro!
Ya, you have any others?
Oh, I can wait..
Yeah.
(Declaring) I'm out!
Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
A bris? You mean circumcision?
Now, where's that tool shed of yours?
You can get that in your arms?
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
Alright come on.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
12,000 BTU's.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
Well, I like yours.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
Go ahead smell, smell
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
Hey.
The coffee was too hot.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
What?!
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
Hey
Hmm. That's a shame.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
How much are you down altogether?
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
Awright, my work is done here.
Hey, Elaine.
Our rickshaw?
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
I got a stone.
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
(in pain) Ow! Jeez!
Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
"Hey Jimmy"
Is Elaine going?
Yeah.
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
Tantric yoga?
Good luck with that.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Hello, boys and girls.
Well, I guess I was..
Yap I know.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Really? Feels like Tuesday.
Got a minute?
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
Can you do that for me, buddy?
Hey, watch where you're kicking!
Bald?
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
That musta been some kind of doll.
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
Ya.
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
You dont?
It's macaroni Midler.
Well, thats a weird thing to say
Commando 8 has arrived!
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
Yeah.
Ive gotta feed the birds.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Assman.
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
That's right.
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
No. It says 'main line'.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Hi...........What's that?
A mouse!
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
Paella, ya I'll be there.
Why?
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
All right, geez. You're crazy.
Look, you gotta do me a favor.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
Hey, hey, hey.
You see?
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
What do you mean?
Well, are you gonna wear it?
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
Elaine
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
What, he's not here yet?
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
I'm not, I'm running it.
Oh, hey,
Yeah, those are New York plates.
Oh, like you're gonna stop?
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
Uh, Cosmo Kramer?
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Y'aah!
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
They wont take a cage full of birds.
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
What?
So, okay uh whats the problem?
No, it doesn't work.
What?
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
I thought you said she stinks
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
Jeez!
Kramerica is no more.
Youre a human being.
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies.
Oh, hello.
(like rainman)"Yeah! heading home."
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
(smelling) What's burning?
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
Alright, c'mon!
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
Oh. I'll lug.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)
That's all I got.
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Got any coffee?
Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.
Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!
What is this, oregano?
Jerry, he probably had a cold.
No, not these. These were real hooters.
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
George is saying "Cut it."
No way!
How do those lifts feel?
Oh I got the ball.
That's what they gave me.
(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens)
Yes, because they've already deducted it.
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
All right.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
Ma?
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
Uh, let's see... well.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
... Cou, ye, ge...
I thought I DID!
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
Pffft - wrong.
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
Not at all.
Stefanie. 2-G.
Well, ah you were right.
Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
The discount pharmacy?
So he actually had it?
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
Oh, no you don't.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Uh huh.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
Damn!
I think I hit my head again!
What? What? What? Tell me.
I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
(mumbling with full mouth) No, Im good.
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
What?
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!
Quality time.
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Oh yeah, she's fantastic....
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
You can't get it from that.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Oh...no.
You wanna go get him?
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Watch it good.
What?
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Is too.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
what?
I know, it's a long story.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Hi.
No time!
The bank can pay 'em.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
How tall are you?
Oh, conversion rate, oh.
Oh, you better believe it!
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
Yeah.
And to the bathroom.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Ouch!!..........Now!!
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
No, no, no. I looked.
Yay!
Hey.
Erika, she's Erika
hell-oo
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
Good, huh?
So why don't you just go?
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Hey.
Well, now I can't see Jerry.
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
His cat's gone.
Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!
Who's to say it didn't?
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Jackie we gotta talk.
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
Happy birthday paruba!
(shivering) Hypothermia.
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
Thats you.
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
He wants to talk.
Wha...?
Yeah
Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?
(low tone) All right.
That's what I wanna know.
I love you, too, buddy, and George--
Youre not going?
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
MUST be banker.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
Hey.
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Yeah, sure. Please.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
(positive) That makes me the premiere.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
Jerry!
They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
That's gunna be trouble.
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
Because of the coffee thing?
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
What bachelor auction?
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
Mickey!
Yeah.
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
Yeah ... backstage.
Aaaahhh...!!!
Yeah.
Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Hey, Jerry.
Yeah.
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
Ooh, it's a big one!
(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable.
Well, you're going over there.
Didn't we come in over there?
From you?
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
Why not?
ah! Here we go.
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
What, youre not gonna tell me?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Tupperware.
(hesitant) Uhm...
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
Ahh.
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
About the opera.
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
Hey! Couch is comin.'
Elaine?
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
Hey.
You're a chucker.
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
That smell. What's that smell?
Ah, you remember.
He just sunk like a stone.
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Hey! Elaine..
Never!
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
What?
Maybe I will.
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
You didn't get the blood from me.
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
OH! GOD HELP US!!!
Y'know, art's a great investment.
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
Now what's with you?
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
No, no, I'm working on it.
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
(indicating) You see? You can't let go.
Como se dice.. waterbed?
Yeah (to buzzer)
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
why can't you make a higher roof.
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
Hey.
You can smell me without the drink.
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Shall we go?
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
(looking at watch) Ssssh--ah! They just closed!
You got a blender.
Good one? It's the Commando 8.
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Got to.
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
No no, he's fine.
Elaine?
I take baths.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
Oh, yeah.
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Nothin'
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
Well what are you doing here?
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
Hes a go getter!
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
God!
So, who is your doctor?
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
Did you tell him the Packyderm story?
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
Yello?
Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.
Hey.
Ok, it's forgotten.
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
Bania?
Not as many as there used to be.
Oh, that's my phone.
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
(to baby) Koochie koochie koochie koo
Okay.
Yeah.
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Hi.
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
(Confused) What?
Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
I'm in love.
Oh mama.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
Here you go.
That guy.. He was just...
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
Ah!!! Yahh!!!
Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
Yo
I'm shaving with it.
Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
What? What are you talking about?
I told you I was gonna get it.
Habla espanol?
Is this the interference?
I don't know.
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
(whistles) What's he like huh?
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
Yep. (Mumbles off)
Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
Wellll, isn't it obvious?
Whatever you get.
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.
No, no, I got it.
I think we lost him.
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
(quietly, to himself) Look at this.
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Do you want more pastrami?
Huh, Okay.
Let me have her number.
(doing the voice) La la la.
Exactly
Well, now look, just leave me alone.
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
Ah-huh.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
We'll take it!
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
Well, you're pregnant.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
You don't know what you're missing buddy.
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
What?
Maybe I outta go over there.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
Because I don't have a table.
Whoa!
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
I'll bet I can guess it.
No, blame me.
Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.
Thats okay. He doesnt care.
What stuff?
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
We're gonna be right there.
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)
I gotta find another shower.
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
I think we've all experienced that.
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
Yeah, I kissed her.
(smiles) yeah.
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
Neither are you.
I don't have it, I threw it out.
Mary Kay uh?
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
(Together) Sucker..
Go ahead, drink it, George.
Well, he's still a conductor.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
Cause they look comfortable.
You looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
Wide open!
What card?
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
Yeah yeah.
Ya I told you.
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
What time do you need it at?
Thanks man.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
We're putting in cable.
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
Mmm.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
It was an accident.
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
What?s his message like?
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Well, I havent changed my mind.
Ya
Hes in the music business.
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
Bulimic,
Five minutes. What?
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
What are you all dressed up for?
Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
That's the idea.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
It's Keith.
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Hey!! Frank just called me. Congratulations.
He overcooked it. It's ruined.
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
They want to know why they never see you.
Yeah.
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
A pig-man. Half pig, half man!
Oh, gees...
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
Hot and spicy.
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
Oh, not a problem.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
Hey.
(frustrated) Wha??
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
Phew!
A dotchie cotchie dochie,
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
Yeah, I turned up the heat.
Are you still on the pill?
No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
Well, please?
Ah ha!
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
Here, take one.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.
Newman!
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
Ah, well, it's a business transaction.
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
Ah, I'm glad you're here.
No...
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
Who's that?
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
Hey buddy.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
Me?
But I did sit in mud.
Whats this?
Because we're engaged.
The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
What?
What?!
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
Hey.
You got cigars, huh.
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
Yeah. He's intense, man.
Yeah,
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
Newman! Newman!!
(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.
Well I'm a guest.
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
Wha, you too?
Newman! Hes good friends with him.
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Yes, yes I am.
Con dios? Well, that's rude.
Well, this is a surprise ha?
Hey.
Don't step on anything.
Uh, Varnsen.
Well, that's weird.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Well, why not?
He's very generous, isn't he?
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
And?
Yeah.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Oh, yeah.
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
You drank a whole bottle of water.
Why doesn't he just move in here?
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.
Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
Because it's no good.
You said it, sister.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
What's doing?
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.
You got the paper yet?
(stops) W--Reggie Miller.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Morty, are you coming in?
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
Oh, yeah.
Yes she is...
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
L'Occupado.
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
(to George) What's with you?
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
What...?
Yeah. me neither.
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
What happened?
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
I don't believe that.
There you are.
Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
I'd like to get some coffee.
It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
Hey!
Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
That kid...
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
I didn't say anything.
Oh, I'm with him.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
But it's Festivus.
(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
I wanna be a pirate.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
Ch- oo-... what?
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
(seeing Jerry is with people) Oh.
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
Naw, that's not my style.
Why?
No, taste it. Taste it.
Why, what's wrong with bro?
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
...Okay, yes, shoot.
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
I'm the real Peterman.
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
Of what?
Rock, paper, scissors match.
(doing the voice) La la la.
Ya.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
Heey!
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
What, you took a cab?
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Well, just tell me everything, huh?
Whoa, I'm Kramer.
Why? What happened?
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
These are my friends Jerry and Elaine.
What?
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
How's that feel?
There's no water pressure.
(Between coughs) Hey.
We'll see you Dwayne.
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
Yeah.
So, what's your talent?
Hey, what's he doin'?
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
Giddy-up!
Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!
George, we're sorry.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
Hey, Brody!
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
Tell me about it.
(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
My Little Jerry! (Runs out.)
I told you I sold them to Bania.
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
My stuffed cabbage!
I can't work with these!
A gymnast!
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
Nothin'
Hang on.
Why?
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
Hey! George.....Lily..
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
Uhm...
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
(mocking) Too bad you got engaged.
Mama!
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Hey.
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
1937, 1937, 1937...
Uh, 42.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
What's that smell?
That's correct.
Don't take my money!
She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
What, again? You took one this morning.
Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
No, I fled the scene.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
[In Newman's ear] I don't like it...
How can I possibly thank you?
You know Frank, you could take a break.
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
I was never able to become a banker.
Uh huh.
Uh, no.
You're all right
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
George, we got a problem.
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
About two hours.
I don't know.
(to the intercom) Come on up.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Well I'm boycotting it.
What?
You weren't even married yet.
(quietly) Jerry.
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
When you getting it back?
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
Do I smell?
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
Hey.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
You got ripped buddy.
Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
Just give me another chance!
Maybe.
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
I don't know..
Hey.
No, Jerry!
He's quite a character, isn't he?
So you don't think it's a good idea?
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
..you know, very casually,
Oh, you liked it huh.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
Hi guys.
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
Hey, Frank.
What whip?
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
(surprise) What?
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
George. I thought you were gonna Change.
Yeah, well, that was a good one.
Hey.
What is it blowing up?
You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
It's Pagliacci!
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
I'll show ya Rusty.
Hey man, what's going on?
What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
Yeah.
Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Well hello Photo store Sheila.
(Laughing) What is that, a new bit?
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
It's definitely preposterous.
What, are you locking the door now?
(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.
Woah! Wait!
How ya feelin'?
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
Are you sure?
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Yeah.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
Yeah. Nice meeting you.
Yeah, your phone is line one.
yeah
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
Well?
Are too.
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
Wait a second....
You just answered your own question.
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
You've been warned.
This hallway smells like potatoes.
Yeah.
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Yeah, but I prefer the bro.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
That's... even better!
There you go monkey boy.
Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
Back and to the left
(as he leaves with it) Crackers.
Yeah.
Drive the horse?
Why not?
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
Pretty good, huh?
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Call him and tell him
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
I like what you've done with that.
HUAAHHH!!
Jerry, how about you?
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
Now that's impossible.
You just blew my mind.
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
We ran outta space.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
$17.50. You can't beat that.
Who could love me?
Come on ,Just take a taste
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
If you like her, go talk to her.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
Yeah. (leaving)
You can have this one.
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
"HEY I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!!!"
Oh, boy.
Course I will. These are staples.
Patience.
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
Scared of being shot.
Yayaya...
Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
I got fired from the movie.
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Newman?
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
Oh. (Waiter approaches table)
Oh. Delicious to meet you.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
Great.
I thought she was pregnant.
Hey, well, this is Sally.
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
I'm the babysitter
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
Is too.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
Ah!
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
Here's your scrubber back.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Me neither.
That's good thinking.
(handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.
He's ripping me off
You guys ready?
Uh, Swiss.
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
Well, I can't!
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
I don't know where the tops are.
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
Oh, I love curls.
I guess she was hot.
Eh! Come on. What did you say?
No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
He's spaced out.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Alright, but no bites.
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
How's your evening?
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
Well, that's out of the question.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Hey, Georgie.
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
And go we will.
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
But why?
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
Ok, I'll go with you.
Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
C'mon!
Hey, how's it goin'?
Where are you going?
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
Joes?
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
Quone. To quone something.
(realisation) Mother's Day.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
... My mother's a matron!
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
Why were you holding the door open for?
You know I never got a library card.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
Well it's 555-3455.
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
Watch out, boy.
Sure, do you need a glove?
It's Jell-O.
Really, Ah,
I was going to dump this.
I've been thinking about something.
Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.
Help me Father. Help me.
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
Hey.
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
(puzzled) I think so.
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
You ever seen Michael Jordan?
You can't get a stool in here.
No, Sir. We are down there.
Yeah.
Yup! Yup!
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
Double bugger!
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
(to Mickey) What about lifts?
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
(to Gary) How you doing?
oh oh oh oh oh
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
And you're going to go out with her.
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
Well, there is something you can do.
it was your fault
Poor Lily..
hey
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
Yeah. Where's yours?
No, I want you to see me naked.
Oh, mama.
(looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.
(Struggling) Hey!
(cries out) WELL I SAID I'M SORRY."
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
Hey, what's going on?
Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!
Joey
There's no problem, really.
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
They're never in contention.
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
Rock.
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
So, is everything cool? or what?
Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
Well come on George, finish the story.
Oh come on, You can tell me.
It was supposed to erupt.
It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
Three under par.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Yallo. What delay industries?
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
Oh, I gotcha (clicks)
Another Festivus miracle!
What's the matter? You've got a cold?
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
How did this happen?
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
No, no.
What is that a Titleist?
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Really?
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
Do over  start with him.
Yeah, Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?
Yeah.
What about her?
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
Bad news, my friend.
Naomi, come on let's get goin'.
Well, why no T-bone?!
This slicer is indomitable.
So now, what's this got?
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
It's a sweater.
You are a lover boy!!
You got butchered.
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
Maestro.
"Lets share.. we share....Awight"
(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!
Well, yeah.
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
Well I ...
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
I put them on a dental chair.
So...how was the dinner last night?
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
HeYAWaaa
Woah, woah, come on.
Uh... great.
What do ya mean?
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
I'm getting my pot.
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Funny.
(trying to get away) woah
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
No! Don't!
Why not?
I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.
All right, What about the money?
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.
Well? Did he call?
Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
Yeah, I've seen them do that.
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Well, what about your deal, huh?
"No,No...You were here first."
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Hey.
Well, that's good news.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
I'm puttin it on
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
An In The Park Home Run!
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
Oh, we go back a ways.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
She's got a kid?
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
What's a Chow Fung?
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
(Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?
Wait, wait, (Exits)
Yeah, about two hours.
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Oh, hey, how you doing?
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
I may be old, but I'm spry.
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
huh.. my batteries are dead
Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]
(not understanding him) Hey, thanks.
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
What's the matter?
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
What is this, huh?
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
My whole lot?
(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
Was it more than just one?
(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
I got carpool. (exits)
Hey.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
Uh, hey buddy.
"Boy , you're looking sharp there Tim."
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
No, no, no. There was no money.
No.
Yeah -- yeah.
(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.
Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
Remember this?
I'm hip.
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Hey, that's supposed to be great.
What?
Downtown.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
That's right.
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
yeaaaaah!
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
Hello!
I will lose that nail.
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Well, I don't think they're real.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
Jer.
The tobacco companies.
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Yeah. Open it.
Oh yeah!!
This ramp is steep.
Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
Me too.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola.
I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
And she doesn't know anything, about this?
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
Hey.
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
Wow.
What?
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Whatever it takes.
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
All right, so we let the girls decide.
(pleased) Really?
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
So I'd like to give it to you.
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.
All right....Sit down George.
A picture.
No problem there.
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!
Would you like a refund?
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
Talk to me baby.
It was under a spoon!
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
Jerry!
Well, I sold them to Bania.
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Heey.
Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?
Hey! Mike!
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
Bennette right?
How serendipitous.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Yyyeeaaah!!
I got them too.
I know what I'm gonna say.
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
Its all supervised.
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
(playing with his hair) Talk to him.
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
Git.
Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.
So, Im Filk?
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
(clattering inside) That wasn't me!
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
Huh?
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
HE..YA. AYA. AYYYYYAAAAA!!!!
No, no. A bra is for ladies.
Well, thank you.
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
All righty...
Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
The woman is a menace.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
On the signal, George. On the signal.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
Huh?
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
It's terrible!
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
Well, Im taking this back.
What's Filk?
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
What's this?
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Oh yeah (quietly)
Did you offer those guys a drink?
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
All right
Hey you got it.
what is this?
Yaya
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
Oh, yes, I am.
You gave up the voice?
What's that perfume?
"How?"
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
It's not going to happen again!
Well they gotta be soft.
George, I thought that was the door.
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Conceivably.
(quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
Quo? Thats not a word.
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
I found it on the road.
Hey.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
Hey, eh, Lew!
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
[In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...
He almost beat me.
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
Hey, I told you.
Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
Yeah.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
I told you he could do it.
(matter of fact) He had breasts.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah that's right.
Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
Yeah.
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Double?
Lets go get him.
Clear blue sky!
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
Racquet.
Yeah.
Right.
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
I know where I?m standing.
(overly excited) Hey (Claps hands one time)
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)
Well, I'm not giving it back.
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
Oh, you have no idea.
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
I love her!
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
How about a bathroom?
Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
You're not pregnant?
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
No, of course not. (winks back)
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.
Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!
Have you seen George?
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Oh, come on.
Yeah. That's them.
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.
Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
Youre not going to wear this.
Yeah.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Hey.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Cash.
Oh - I'm familiar with it.
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
No. It belongs to the British.
Well, I practically raised his kids.
..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!
So...
Wait, wait, wait...
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
(enters) Well.
Oh
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
(rips open package) Yeah, that's...
You must be kidding.
(Flattered) Oh?
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Im not happy about this.
Hey.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
Yeah that's right.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
How do you know?
Of course, yes.
"Hey! What's this?"
You shoulda come, Jerry.
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
Uh, Dwayne.
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
Um-hm.
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
uh..
Okay, I beg you.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
GO! GO!!
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.
There's Salman.
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
Hey.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Look, she didn't mean anything.
My contention?
Ohh!
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
(a bit startled) Ahh.
That's for radiation.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Hmm-mmm.
Rock.
Brody's in.
You mean you've never tasted lobster?
(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Can I sleep with you?
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
(enters apartment) Hey.
Yes.
Well, doesn't he need that?
I'm Cosmo.
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
What else?
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
I sure am.
That was the wrong card.
It's weighing on my conscience.
Mickey Mantle.
Yeah, something like that.
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
(claps hands) Yes indeed.
Oh. Come on.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
Hey, Morty.
Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.
Well, where is it?
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
Name's Kramer.
What time is it?
Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over.
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
I'm goin' to Newman's!
I never take it.
Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?
Good idea.
Okay, how much?
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
I want to capture this.
Ashtrays?
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
City or highway?
(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
Boss!
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
No no. Its all in my head.
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
Oh, and that voice!
Well, the pleasure's all mine.
Oh, no.
So, what's George doing?
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
Uh huh, right.
yeah!
Giddyup.
No.
"Eh!! Cosmo Kramer. Nice to meet you"
Smile, everyone! We're back!
What happened to the doll?
(to Jerry) Hey, man.
Ooh! Remember Poppie?
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
There were 1,650 survivors.
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
Ya I didn't know you could cook.
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
I tell you how much I make.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
Have a good one.
Oh, that's too bad.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
No.
Well, I overbought!
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
Hah?
(sort of falling backwords) Yowm!
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
I know how to sign.
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
I'm sure it'll come out.
September third.
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Alright, we'll take the subway.
(To Jerry) Yates.
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
(theatrical) I made a mistake.
I love her, Jerry!
Oh, geez..
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
Alright you go ahead.
That's nice..
What's that?
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
So how much are we gonna make?
Hey.
(to Mickey) You know? She's right.
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
Big mistake.
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
Yeah, well nothing before noon.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Then we're cool.
All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?
Ya?
let go, hey grab the rock
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
You are one sick mama I like it.
Oh yeah!
oh that wouldn't be very good
Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!
I sure am.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
Oh yeah right it's raining.
I am dressed.
What banking?
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
Oh, stop saying 'reneging".
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
Yeah.
Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.
You have to know everything, don't you?
Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?
That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!
No!
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.
Well, move in here.
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
How about Idi Amin, huh?
Ah, I got it.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Oh, yeah.
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
This was set for 2 minutes. See?
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
(indicating) The door's on a diagonal.
I'm sorry.
He doesn't like you.
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
Yey eye ca-catfight.
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
Who died?
(pointing) That's her, officer.
Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
Mickey, DTs.
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
It's got an alarm that beeps!
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
Doc, huh?
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
Hips! See, its all hips.
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
Who's Gennice?
Out.
I don't have anything. Ask him.
Hi.
Done!
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
What are YOU doing here?
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
Ok.
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
I liked Marlene. Whats her number?
What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.
Go ahead, drink it, George.
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
Ya.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
Why not? hey what about you George?
So I, I didn't do anything wrong.
You're in a weird mood.
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
When do you pit the sauce on?
Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
Sister Roberta gave it to me.
Yeah!
Well I came back for you.
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Hey.
She quit.
Yeah,I had a tough day
What's that red dot on your sweater?
Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
You just gotta mention my name.
(leaves, upset) Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--
Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
I just need it, that's all.
No! She needs it now!
Hey.
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
Yeah.
Hey, Frank!
Alright, what size are you?
(Ow!) It's my stomach.
Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Well I suppose they are wasted.
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
Yeah...
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Yeah, a different one.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Maybe she's bulimic
Do it. Do it. This.
Right this way, mister Doody!
(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Oh, hey.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Yeah (again quietly)
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
Ohhhh, what's this?
That was a close one.
Yeah.
Awright, hands up, porky!
Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
Oh, yeah, that's...
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
You Gack?
Thanks. Have a good day.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
Run, run! Go, go, go!
Yo yo ma.
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna.
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
Aahh...Who's Janet?
Let me talk to him.
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Oooooh ...Pops .... Wow!! Spectacular.
who?
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
HUAAHHH!!
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
Hey!
Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
You're right he's ripping me off
Mmm, these are good, huh?
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?
Well so she faked 'em, so what?
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
Y'ello?
Any news?
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Oh I can be quite litigious.
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
OH! I got to call her back.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
George I told you we're booked!
Well let's sit down.
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!
What did I just say?
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
Hey you!
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
what?
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
It's me!
That's fine.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
NEWMAN ! Stop it!!
Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?
Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?
Hey, see, I like it like this.
"What!!!"
(Laughing) She caught you?
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Well I didn't hear any Plus.
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
(Complaining) No more golf.
Psst. Hey.
Well,
Jerry, the whole building is brick.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
Well, get him to bark.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
'felt that the conversation was lagging.
You called me?
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
Yeah. Move along, Betty.
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Hey!
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Did you ask her about me?
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
The AC is on it's way.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
What?
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Newman?
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
Yippie-yi-yay!
George, you gonna buy a painting?
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Oh, yeah.
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Alright.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
(cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.
Uh-huh. Its good?
Hey! Anybody home? Oh boy.
Frank!
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
You killed.
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
Giddyup.
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
(takes a breath)
Jerry, you gotta help me!
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
No, I want to speak to the manager.
"You should take cold showers."
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
Hey, Silvio!
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
Uh, yeah.
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
C'mon , c'mon what's the matter?
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
You wanna rent a movie?
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Hey.
No, don't, don't make me
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
What? Jimmy Sherman?
Well, I didnt think ahead.
Jerry . . .
(approving) Yeah.
Wait a second. I can get change.
You said take 'em.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
And laughter is the best medicine.
(shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
No. It's Original Ray's.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.
Well!
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
Stay strong buddy.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
Talkin' to that woman.
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
(dismissive) Yeah.
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
It's Grossbard!
Yeah.
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
ho ho ho ho.
Jerry, you should pay that price.
Whats to think about?
Is that seat taken?
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
It's Pam.
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
Hey.
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Come on, try it on.
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Fungi.
I think she liked me.
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
Oh.
When we went to dinner the other night.
Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
What about the baby?
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Defective.
Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.
I'll break.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
No.
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
And..voila!
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
Oh? How do you figure?
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
But this'll get you around?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
Well, I beg to differ...
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
Oh, these are nice corners, huh?
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
We're straightening out!
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.
Sue her?
"Well.. Aye can't hold the water."
Well no, I don't have them on me.
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
Hey buddy. Remember me?
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
What happened to Newman?
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
[OC] THE BEACH!!!
Oh yeah she's a beauty.
Yeah.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
Hi.
No.
Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.
Aah!
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Wonder what's goin' on.
Yeah, that def jam is a force.
Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)
Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
What? It's a beautiful day.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
I'll bring back the pot.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
(Thinks) No, I don't think so.
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Don't be a fool.
Well, you better get on the horn.
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
So, so.
hey
Oh, well, yeah, it's good.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
Not THAT hot.
What?
More? More than three thousand?
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
(To Driver) Hey, let me drive.
"They're Plyometric.(sp?)"
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
I've always wanted to see this.
(entering Monk's) Hey, you guys.
Oh, I get by.
Consolation Guy is big.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
No, it didn't say anything.
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
(immaturely) I guess.
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
All right, I'll see you later.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
Elaine.
Oh,
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
That you Bobby?
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Umas number is on that ticket.
(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
Oh, I'm the real deal.
No, they never heard of him.
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
Um hm.
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
Yeah, I love going to the country.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
Well, you can't leave now.
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
Yeah.
I have no concentration!
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
Oh, there's leg work.
"So what's wrong with that?
Is that from Henry the Eighth?
Hey, sorry I'm late.
(opening the fridge) Sayonara.
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
Yeah.
Heh.
Do you ever yearn?
Oh, congratulations.
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
Yeah! Well, are you going out?
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
No, that's yours. My half is gone.
Well, you'd better take it easy.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
Well my stomach was burning.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Darren is going away for a long long time.
Hi Mr. Clotworthy
Oh, you don't say.
Uh huh.
Yaaaa.
I don't know it's up to you.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
I'm loving this.
oh, what's that from?
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Hey! Jerry!
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
Just gonna find out if he's interested.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Look, let me handle this.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.
What?
Hey! You're back!
(Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
Turn on the TV.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
(Thinks) 1500 dollars.
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
What?
Yeah.
Jeannie left?
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
Hey, you got any Double Crunch?
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Yeah..
(entering) Hey.
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
Oh, I'll be back.
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
uuh-
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
What state?
...I didn't say that, no.
Yeah.
(yelling) DARREN!
(Squirming) Jerry! What?!
...All right ..Starting now......
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
"Yes sweep."
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Well, maybe I did overextend myself.
Huh?
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Hey, hey.
Shh, shh.
So...you're the Assman.
No. No
You'd think...
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
That's better than we estimated.
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Eh! Bingo.
yeah yeah, (in a flinty voice) flinty
(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?
Yeah.
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
Come on. Where'd you go?
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
No, that's no good. I'm leaving.
(does a double take) Yikes.
Oh I'm down.
You? You're getting old.
(knocks on desk) Is thi oak?
Yeah.
Hey.
Just get some gum or something.
Alright, how often do we do it?
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Well, you're getting heavy.
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Well, how did they get your face?
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
Huh?
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
Okay, who wants meatloaf?
Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
C'mon Seattle, let's go.
Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
A hole in one eh.
Hello.
That's a lotta yearning, huh?
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
Well I have the same shirt.
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
yeah
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
Tuesday? Uh...
$15.90.?
Y-Yeah, all right.
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
I have to?
Yeah.
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Oh, yes indeed...
Yeah.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.
I'm good for it.
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
No, I got the tape right here.
Huh? Who are you?
What are you talking about?
It's like ten dates in one shot.
Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
Are you sure you're not pregnant?
Yeah, I snuck a peak.
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
(Definite) Cigars.
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
Yeah. Well, he's a dear.
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
Oh... yeah...
Well, It's quite a thrill.
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
I'm fried.
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
She was flouting.
And you'll get it back.
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Hey.
I just assume not sit next to you.
Yeah. See ou later..
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
Oh help me man, I'm desperate!
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
What did this guy do? What happened?
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
Yeah. So long, Morty.
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
Yeah. (Exits)
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.
Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby)
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
A stall man, huh? (small laugh)
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
Right by her!
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
So go. GEORGE Here?
Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Do you like tsimmis?
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
You should sleep with him.
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
You got any of those mini Ritzes?
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
Mine, too. I got one more day.
I am Kramer.
(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem.
I know.
Don't blame me.
You got it?
Double exclamation point!
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
(quietly) Hey Jerry.
I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
Well, then, he's out!
Let's go!
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
Hey.
Would you stop it.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
Aw, you really hurting, huh?
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
Well what are we ...dog meat.
Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
Uh, no, no, not yet.
(to George) Hey buddy.
I didn't know.
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
Well, I don't know what to do.
Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
New cards, huh?
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
Yaow.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
hey
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
Uh-huh.
Okay, what do you got?
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Sure do.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
Oh Movie Phone.
So , you blew it?
Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro.
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
Oh, boy.
Oh, he's cold.
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
I'm asking you!
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
We'll see you later...
Taste this.
Hey.
Well you can go to your room and read.
No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
Only in The United States.
Rock.
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Where's a phone?
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
Oh You are so freaking talented.
Who did?
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
Who says I want a noodle?
I'm down.
Do I think? He's repugnant.
Does that bother you?
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
Well, why don't you do your material?
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Oh, the one with the crest.
Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
Its beautiful.
Well, he was a little standoffish.
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
Yea, yea.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm)
Yeaaahmm....
She's fat.
Yeah!
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
You wanna keep your job don't you?
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
Yeah, uh.
That's pretty good, huh?
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
Flea bites?
(from inside) OK!
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
No no no. End of the month.
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
No, they're good! Take one..
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
Jerry, what is your problem?
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
That's right
Because he's scared, Jerry.
Oh, come on.
Elaine!
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
Yea.
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
Oh, you don't remember me.
Same old, same old.
Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
Hey!
(acting standoffish) Hello.
I'm off hot water.
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?
I thought you said it was a scratch.
Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
Why?
Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
Equivalency.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
Yeah, here it is... yeah.
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
Well, just save me a seat.
Hey buddy! Hey!
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
I wouldn't walk over there.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
Yeah, sit, sit, sit Weeell! (laughing, clapping)
Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Sell it, just say Im selling!
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
But where does the meat go?
Yeah I could have helped you out.
"Ohhh H'am loaded."
Yeah.
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
"I'm a guest of honor."
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
Cigars? (hits the box)
Yeah.
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
Be realistic George.
(leaving) Aw.
How many miles?
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
You cooked?
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
Two is better than one.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
What beats rock?
Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
Toxic gas!!!
Hey.
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
You're positive it's statute?
Hey, where's Jerry?
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
I don't like her.
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Yep.
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
You're scared of Elaine?
That's weird.
Hey, did that guy show up?
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
"Oh yes, yes indeed."
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
And I need something to write on.
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
For what?
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
Oh, my God...
George, they closed up.
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Lock and load.
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
I thought paper covered rock?
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
There they are.
What's Festivus?
All right, I'll see you later.
Hey. It's really wet out there.
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
Elaine?
What point?
That's a fallacy.
Yeah.
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
There you go.
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
It was an accident.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
I thought we would blend in.
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
Sure. I will.
Steve Gendason.
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
Hey! (Group does likewise)
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
Yeah.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
Come on Come on!
What?
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.
Woah.
Thats definitely you.
(answering) PBS pledge drive.
Hey!
"Hi Gwen, hi tide."
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
(yells) Newmanniun!!
What, you're giving him this suit?
Come on, one lap around.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
I'm not going back in there!!
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
Barry?
Understand?
All right George, come on, take a look.
Lyndon Johnson.
(to Jerry) Hey, howd you do?
Ooo Paella
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
Heads up!
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
What?
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
Really.
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
No, I swear.
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
I always put you up here...
I can't ...
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
Let me taste it.
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
Yeah.
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
"There's no candy around here. hey! Jimmy."
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
AAH! AAGH!
Why?
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
George?
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Oh, great ride.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Put that on the top of your list.
Come on up. It's Brody.
I know.
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
What's the matter with you?
I don't want to!
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
Well, he can't be disturbed now.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
All the time?
It's just me.
No, it isn't!
So you'll buy them?
Hey!
Sendrax.
You awake?
Uh? Oh that must be it.
(mumbles and leaves)
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Hey, Elaine scratch my back.
Well I got it!
Well, that was alright, huh?
Most of them don't even have batteries.
Yes.
Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.
That's caged heat.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
Oh I'll be up for it punk.
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
Oh yeah? What about?
His tooth marks. He bit me.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
Hey! Hi Elaine!
Yeah, well he started it.
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
He's my caddy.
Oh. What about?
Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
Oh.
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
Yeah,
Now, it's called the bro.
Come on, let's go to the beach.
(clueless) what is what?
Did you hear about Newman?
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
(shocked) How can you not have insurance?
Have you ever met my guys?
Hey, Harold, what do you think?
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
Yeah, yeah. I wonder hmm.
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey
All right, where you going?
How come you never said anything?
Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.
Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
And yet, he's my friend.
She made an offer. I took it.
Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
(yells) Elaine!
Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
All right then, what was it?
"You want me to sleep with you?"
So how's George?
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Well, where's the soup?
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
What is that?
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
How come?
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
Hi.
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Why can't I play Kramer?
enters
That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
(unbelieving) I can have this?!
They're right out here.
Yeah, a real brouhaha...
Ya that was pretty good, huh?
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
What?
Well, they're in...
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
I got mugged.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
Well, wow.
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
No, I'm the baby-sitter.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
Getting some cereal
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
No! Never.
Are you all right?
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
Wrong again.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back--
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
Yeah!!
(Stretching) Oh..
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Yeah.
I'm sorry Jackie.
Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.
Whoa, psychosexual.
Oh, God.
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
Yeah, hi Elaine.
I don't know.
I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
You got money?
Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
hello
Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
Well, more bad news Jerry.
Euh what...What lot is that?
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.
Hey.
I don't know about that outfit though.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
Keflon.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
...And you're the manager of the circus.
Nothin.'
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
No.
Okay, please! Please tell me!
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
That's a nipple.
(immediately) Yeah.
(waving) Shellbach.
You mind if I use it in my book?
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Well, Babe Ruth did it.
(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Read another poem.
Elaine!
Alright, you got something better?
(smiling) Well...
All of it. You want to invest?
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
Oh, thank you.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
Wha-huh-wha-huh...
Oh, yow, oow Ah!
What, did you ask her?
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
Definitely.
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
You suffer for your soup.
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Aw, c'mon.
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
They should be sent to Australia.
1937.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
I too am well.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
Well, youre still here?
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Oh, COME ON!
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
Yes. It's dangerous.
Hey.
Yeah..
I'd love to help you move.
Now, you see, that's nice.
Ok!
(from inside) Yeah?
Is it over four hundred?
Oh, he's a tomcat.
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
Take me where? Where?
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Does your girlfriend have to be here?
There you go.
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
You got anything to drink? Agua?
Arrest?
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
(interested) Uh-huh.
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
I'm doin' fine.
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
Alright, where you going?
Why not?
The party, Long Island?
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
No.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
Yeah, see how you're singing?
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
Oh, they were Chemical.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Keep your foot on the gas.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
What am I supposed to say?
It's not illegal.
Jerry, George!
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Ya!
Yeah, she dumped me!
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
I've got plenty of ideas.
George! George!
Ja ja ja - just tell it
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
Well, I don't want to either.
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
I want one of those!
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
These street toughs, they robbed me.
Hey
You keep him busy.
Yeah, he was fired.
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
Blood!
Yeah, don't I know it.
I didn't realize it was a full box.
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Uh, well, there's someone else.
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
pig-man, baby. pig-man.
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
It was in my laundry.
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
You got that straight.
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
Hey, you know who owns that car?
Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
What?
We could be tried for murder...
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
You didnt want her in the building?
Yeah, go ahead.
Yowza yowza. Check it out.
Double or nothin'.
Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in
Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
Yeah, that's right. You did.
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
What is going on here?
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Oh, mama...
Look look.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Me and Lola....
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Heyy! Look who's here.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
Hey.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
You get the tickets?
Hey...
Jerry this peach is sub par.
Well that's weird
(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?
Oo yiggity diggigg
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
Who are you talkin about?
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
Well, then I was way off!
Stop right there.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
It's your first time. He'll understand.
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
You stink. (He exits)
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Beg me.
Why not?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Hey, how you doin'?
Bye!!
Over there. The Dominicans.
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
Oh, yeah! Me.
Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
A billiard room.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
Oh! yeah.
Are those shoes comfortable?
Steven.
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
Hey.
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
You don't think so.
(Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
Yeah, there's something in the air.
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
Really?
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
(RE CAR) I found it!
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
Oh, we have to do this now.
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
I don't want this on my conscience.
(shaking hands) Yeah.
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
His mudda' was a mudda'.
Get out of here.
Huh? Yeah.
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
Is, uh, David Puddy there?
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Easy Mickey, easy.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
And it could be done.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
It changes the molecules.
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
Well there ought to be ball men.
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
I got a quality.
Yeah.
Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)
But she really looks like a Lily
(to door) Gah!
Come on. Are you sure?
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
Well, it's common sense.
(quietly) L-l (look)
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
Uhummm...
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Hi
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
Uh, well, uh, we --
What?
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
Rusty!
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
The little man knows all.
Oh! Big surprise ( he leaves frustrated)
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
Oh, that's a prickly one.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
What are the chances of that?
Yeah.
Hello boys.
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
What's happenin' here?
(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
Well, I'm still shopping it around.
(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
Huh?
Her birds are dead.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
So, huh?
There was an incident.
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
Do you have any prospects?
Disaster.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Hey, buddy, don't say no!
Come on, take some. It's good.
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
I'm going.
(noise)
No, I got 'em in the ocean.
Well, I'd say it nicely.
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
make me an offer.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
I got it! This time, I got it!
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
YAH! (exits)
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
'bout what?
"So you got any cavities?"
You scream good.
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
It's just...it's no picnic.
You got that straight.
You got any shredded coconut?
"Whooo!"
Oh hey!
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
No.
I told you she liked me.
Ooo!
Yeah, stir it up so it melts.
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
Want any help?
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Yeah, ok.
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
Shut up! I'll get my coat!
Did you hear about Martin?
So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi
She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
Oh, hey, hi buddy.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
No. He doesn't know.
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
How much do you make?
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
That's true. That's right.
(somewhat under his breath) Ya ya.
Well, I'm off to the links.
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
Look, just meet with him. ?????.
Well, is it good?
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
It's this way.
Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
I thought we were talking about me.
Sure.
Well, coffee tables.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
No, five. But you were close.
Yeah?
(intrigued) Really?
Hey buddy.
Oh, memory burn.
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
Right on the mouth.
Yeuu.
Can't help ya, kid.
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
Look at you.
Ooh tattle tale
A sweat shop.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Hey.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
Brown?
[Yeah] (through the door)
It's just Original, Jerry!
Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
Why?
You got that straight!
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
What?
I'm calling Jerry.
I have a pen.
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Oh, tough crowd.
No
Not bloody likely..
Davola?
Serenity! (He exits)
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
Hey.
What do you mean?...
What do you mean, a broad noodle?
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Why?
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Hey, Ralph.
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
Um, Uh, ugh, ...
Yeah.
You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
Well, this is Kramer.
What do you mean?
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
Hey.
I go in front first all the time.
It's cucumbers.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
What's a Chuckle?
Yep.
Right.
Yeah, went straight to video.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
Well, not here.
(an idea occurs) You don't say.
OK. Let's turn the water on now.
Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
I thought it was here.
Vaguely.
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
What happened?
Gawd!!!
That's your problem, buddy.
What's in the deep end?
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
Oooh, lobsters.
Really.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
Nothin'.
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
The Ball, silly.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
Well I don't, I'm guessing.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
Sorry.
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
(screaming) Waahhh!!!
Buenos dias.
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
I get to play Kramer.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
No.
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Hey. These are for you Olive.
Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Hey.
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
Hey boss.
I'm Kramer.
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
I need to talk to you.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
Fling!
How did they ever find you?
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
Woah, woah, that's mine.
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
What about him?
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Yeah.
Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.
(shouts) Connie!
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
(from outside) Hello?
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
My job. What are you doing?
Why don't you take a handicap spot...
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
I thought it was a closet.
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
It's just a write off for them.
(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.
Since when are you so trendy?
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
Yeesh-jip!
10-4.
Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?
Let me talk to Calvin.
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
All right, you're not fancy!
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
What?
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
Nope. No good.
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
(waving wing) Hey buddy.
I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
Oh yeah, yeah.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
Well, you should, Jerry.
Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
Jerry what's the matter?
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
No, no! My car's not running.
What?
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
Well, this has all been one big tease!
(Confused) What is up with you two?
(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
(low tone) All right, yeah.
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now.
yep.
Bro.
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Whoop! Whoop!
Sister Roberta.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
Oh yeah.
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's queer uh?
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
Yeah, all right.
Help me!! Help me!
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
(Snaps) The Place To Be!
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
Oh yeah!
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
A couple of hours ago.
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
He's lying.
How you doing? (Kramer leaves)
O'Brien? Well that's weird.
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
What, they drove to a dealership?
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
(puzzled) Phone call?
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
Gail Cunningham.
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
What ever turns you on.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.
Take it.
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.
Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
What happened to the car?
Boy...
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
Come on. What'd he say?
Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Real Boss!
Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
Are too.
Fungi.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
(reading) sobs
I don't know.
Too much?!
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Hey.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
And?
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
You know you're going to.
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
You got a dog?
Hey! (moving a chair onto the set)
(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
Mr. O'Neill?
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
Well, he started it!
Well, he thinks you wear those.
There was no plan.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
Well these seats have no lumbar.
Wheehh
What? What?
for a little while
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
It's got to be here.
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Ahh....
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
Tony.
You don't say?
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
No, no. Your not playing the game.
Where you going?
Alright, I'm gonna see you later.
What you doing?!
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
hey
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
What was the question?
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
She kissed me back.
Showering. How long does it take you?
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Have we been intimate?
A big fat turkey.
(He shows her) This umpf thing.
No. No, he can't do that.
(softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale.
Yeah.
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
wow
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
Completely naked.
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.
Feel this.
It felt like 8 seconds.
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
Alright, I'll call her right now.
That's true.
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
Uh, habla ingles?
All right.
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
He's a genius. Here we go...
Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
uptown, to the Y
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
Oh, I'm jiff.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
(putting on the lotion) Ya
I'll tell you how much I make.
Come on JUST TASTE!!!
Okay, Joey.
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
Dark blue.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Its for you.
Sure!
Oh yeah - oui oui.
Really?
Yeah....
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
What?
(to Frank) I told you.
HELLO!
Uh, uh.
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Retail is for suckers.
Yeah.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Quiet, quiet.
Hey!
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
Yeah.
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
What advice would you give young people?
Yeah, it's a windshield.
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.
Now what's that?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
They're trying to screw with your head.
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Yeah, I bought a chicken.
Alright, I'm down.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Because it doesn't concern you.
Well, we'll have to improvise.
Yeah, yeah. I think he will.
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
Why?!
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Forget it.
Meet, the bro.
South America?
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Yeah, come in.
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
No, it's statue.
I came by to get my ball.
Well, I can guess within an hour.
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Hey.
Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Just take one.
She does fine work.
What happened?
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
Junior Mints. Do you want one?
Oh! Come on.
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
I say Japan.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Hey.
Well, would I be able to communicate?
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
She said she'll do it.
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
George says "Cut it."
What are you looking for?
I must know.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Well, we'll see.
Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry.
Hey! You ever been in an accident?
All right, listen. I need some cash.
Right.... Don't mention my name
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
W...It's four.
Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.
Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing)
He's in jail.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
What
YAOH!
Whoa!
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
Sure Mrs. Anvino, ya.
God.
What about Jerry?
Yeah let me borrow your scarf.
I never had an air conditioner.
The machine. You want one?
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
Right!
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
Hey.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Hi.
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
No. No, Elaine!
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
I cant believe hes in a coma.
No, I got a girl in the next building
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)
Well neither am I.
Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Ok, but I got this...
Anything...
Awe, alright
Really?
What is it?
Maybe he's with the company.
Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.
Hey, how about that Toby, huh?
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
No, we're in the same class.
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
Yes, that's my contention.
"yeah, yeah, lets do that."
Tryin' to save a quarter.
Did you bring the video camera?
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Hey buddy.
AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
Jerry, George got arrested.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
What are they gonna do?
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
the rock
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Oh yeah, coming up...
Whoa, back up a second.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
What?
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
Uh, you remember my coffee table book?
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
To the whole scene. (sniff)
Does George know?
(looking down, nodding) Hi.
Bombs away (Uh oh).
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
Yeah, well, no good?
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
Yeah?
No, no, no.
Yeah, morning.
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
Yeah
Devola came after me.
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
I don't know.
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
Whoa!!!....That was you?
That's right. He's a troublemaker.
Well, thank you.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
No.
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Hey!
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
Hey.
Yeah, how was it?
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
Where do you turn it on?
The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.
Ooooh I like Ring Dings.
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
O.K.!
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Awright, I got it.
"What?"
Yeah, that's weird.
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.
Oh I accept.
Ooh, she's a package full of energy!
What is this, parsley?
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?
Getting something to eat.
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
All right, I'm going in.
Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
Yeah. Newman jumped.
Hey.
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
Oh, it's true.
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
(Getting Pulled and pulled) I...um...ei...
Freeze, mother!
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
Is your name Ray?
AH! I don't want her disturbed.
Well I don't remember that part.
(waddling after Joey) Joey! Joey!
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
No. At your apartment.
Antonio. In here!
Wow.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Yea.
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
(proffering) Here, try this pair.
No. They put the top on.
Why don't you just give up?
Don't really remember.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Yes, It's a fine day
I'll pick her up.
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
Egh. These aren't candies.
Oh, come on, they don't drive!
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
Do you have any action at all?
Hahaa!
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
(guiltily) The door.
I went back with Ellen.
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
Hey, you seen the paper yet?
No no look, I was baby-sitting
How long are you staying?
Ah.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
No. Don't, Jerry.
Oh, tell me about it.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
What kind of a person are you?
You've been married three times.
Jerry.... hey Jeannie.
A hand model?
From who?
I'm very, very sorry.
What, is it for a job or something?
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
That's it.
Oh, yeah?
That was alright.
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
You didn't hear?
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
You're joking.
(Making a point) Not everyday.
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
What's wrong?
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
You got a pen?
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
Hey hold that bus!
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
What's today?
(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
Oh, yeah?
Hey! They hooked me up.
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
Heyahhh!
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
Well, what have you been doing?
Where's the lights. Whoa!
(pointing at Farkus) Very funny.
"Go Jimmy"
Yes!
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
What?
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Wish?! Newman!
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?

Hey, now, they're tough cookies.
South America?
What time does that play start?
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
Where can I put this?
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
I got it. Yep.
I can't I can't
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.

Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
He looks happy to me.

Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
I yearn.
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
Haircut.
Yeah, but did you tape it?
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
(CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
No, No You said Hey!
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
Come on...

Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
He's sleeping with his maid!
Relax, he does that all the time.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
Yeah, it's, uh, me.
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
Yeah!
C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
Well, why not.
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Where are they?
Hey.
Hey.
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
Just a little burning during urination.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
Yeah-
I don't like it.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
So long. I'll see you tonight.
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Oh, I really think you're wrong.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Well, how did this happen?
Huh? I don't?
Oh, guess again, Tubby!
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
What? Where are we going?
Oh? Who's Leo?

Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
Yeah.
But I'm tired..
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
He's gonna make us very happy.
Where?
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
So she's coming?
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
Then I'll be back.
Hey, he's a terrific guy.
Really?
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
It's an eyepatch.
Hey.
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
You're *not*!!!
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
No paper?

Yeah, no kidding.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."

What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
Ah, people in this city are crazy.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
No, a thousand!
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
Newman!
Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...
I see.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
(from inside) Security issue!
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
Hey, buddy.
Oh, Ill be comfortable.
I like that eye patch.
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
So, you up next?
So played.
It's Halloween (not sure)
Hey, hey, it's George.
Hi.
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
The only way to fly.
Oh.
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
And you're saying she's deaf.
Lit _ tle Jer _ ry!
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
What?
Yes I did.
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
So what's up, Diggity Dog?
No sweat.
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Yeah, a player...
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Hey I know how to sign.
Uh, yeah, ah ...
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
I dont want the levels!
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
Yeow!
I don't even really work here!
hey
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
And we're off.
Yeah.
Wha? Where?
Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
And Buck Showalter's?
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
Oh.
Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
Uh huh.
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
You begged me.
Hey Maestro!
Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
Uh, Kramer.
Hey!
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
But you *will* use... a retractor.
I drank too much water in the shower.
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
hey George, hear that?
Oh yeah, you talked to her.
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Well, yeah...
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
Yeah!
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Whe have the same symptoms.
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
Gonorrhea!
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
When can you park head first?
Hey, you got the food?
I expect you both to be there.
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
Thats as good as anything you do.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
Yeah.
Very... much...
that's her
Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
(momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
Jerry, you forgot your purse.
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
Giddy-up.
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
(Excited) Done!
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
Definitely.
I'm very happy with this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
George, do me a solid? Two minutes.
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
So you don't know where you got 'em?
Huh?
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
"HEY TAXI!!!.....TAXI!!"
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
Oh, hey.
I dont understand.
I think he looks fantastic.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
Well, I think one of us should leave.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
Unh.... Sorry.
Well, maybe it's the Oreos.
"What!"
It was on the seat...
(pacing back and forth) Ya.
Oh...yeah!
Yeah well we go way back.
Need any help with those?
You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
Yeah, I'll be okay.
(abruptly) Well, I'll see you.
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.

Yeah, me, too.

Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Hey, George, stick 'em up.
"All right euhhm....."
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
What? When did this happen?
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
What?
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
All right, what is your deductible?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
All right, I'll see you guys.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
