Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
They wont take a cage full of birds.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
I was never able to become a banker.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
So you don't think it's a good idea?
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
All right, get off at the next exit.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
I said how come it's takin' so long?
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
You know Frank, you could take a break.
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
No, I want you to see me naked.
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
I didn't realize it was a full box.
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
If you like her, go talk to her.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Well, is it alright if I try it?
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
How often do you cut your toe nails?
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
Why would you think I would invite him?
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
I told you this is all I got.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
I told you I was gonna get it.
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
What, is it for a job or something?
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
No, I want to speak to the manager.
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
Well, I was just trying to help out.
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
You gotta come through with the hips first.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
You know I never got a library card.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
I may have to drive that place out of business.
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
I just assume not sit next to you.
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
No no no, well, then who was it?
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
They want to know why they never see you.
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
I don't have it, I threw it out.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
So, so what do you want me to do?
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
So you don't know where you got 'em?
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
So now he wants her more than ever!
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
You can move in with me, if you want.
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
All right George, come on, take a look.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
No. And now I can't get it back.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
And you're going to go out with her.
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
The name on the boat. Look at it.
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
Darren is going away for a long long time.
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
You mind if I use it in my book?
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
All right, so we let the girls decide.
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
Well open the door, you get a better look.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
No, I got a girl in the next building
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
Not as many as there used to be.
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Well you can go to your room and read.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
I go in front first all the time.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
Well, this has all been one big tease!
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
So I'd like to give it to you.
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
So, what do you think? Does this work?
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
You are one sick mama I like it.
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
Why were you holding the door open for?
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
you know I think you are in love with him
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
What would be the point in taking the water?
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
Well, I think one of us should leave.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
When we went to dinner the other night.
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
I thought you said it was a scratch.
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
