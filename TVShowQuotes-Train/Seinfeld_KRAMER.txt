Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
You are one sick mama I like it.
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
I didn't realize it was a full box.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Henry... can I get out of here now?
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
Well open the door, you get a better look.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
Well you can go to your room and read.
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
Why were you holding the door open for?
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
I thought you said it was a scratch.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
What, is it for a job or something?
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
No, I got a girl in the next building
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
You gotta come through with the hips first.
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Not as many as there used to be.
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
No no no, well, then who was it?
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
I told you this is all I got.
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
I may have to drive that place out of business.
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
No, no. She put a stop to that.
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
So you don't think it's a good idea?
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
And you're going to go out with her.
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
Well, I don't know what to do man!
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
I was never able to become a banker.
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
You know I never got a library card.
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
All right, get off at the next exit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Why would you think I would invite him?
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
If only I could say things like that around her.
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
I just assume not sit next to you.
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Well, I think one of us should leave.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Well, I was just trying to help out.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
I don't have it, I threw it out.
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
All right, so we let the girls decide.
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
I told you I sold them to Bania.
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
You mind if I use it in my book?
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
you know I think you are in love with him
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
I said how come it's takin' so long?
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
So, what do you think? Does this work?
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
You can move in with me, if you want.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
The name on the boat. Look at it.
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
I got it! This time, I got it!
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
If you like her, go talk to her.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
How often do you cut your toe nails?
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
No, I want to speak to the manager.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
So now he wants her more than ever!
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
I drank too much water in the shower.
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
I told you I was gonna get it.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
All right George, come on, take a look.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
Well, this has all been one big tease!
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
No. And now I can't get it back.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
Darren is going away for a long long time.
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
I go in front first all the time.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
Put that on the top of your list.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
So I'd like to give it to you.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
So you don't know where you got 'em?
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
So, so what do you want me to do?
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
They wont take a cage full of birds.
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
What would be the point in taking the water?
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
No, I want you to see me naked.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
