(to Mickey) What about lifts?
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
I would advise against that.
Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum.
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
From who?
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Jerry, where have you been?
Oh, boy.
(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Out.
No, no, no. I looked.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.
Mr. O'Neill?
Oh, mama.
Yes she is...
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Well these seats have no lumbar.
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
Double exclamation point!
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
The pharmacy's still open.
Bro.
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
No. No, Elaine!
That's right.
Ms. Welch.
Oh, I can wait..
Oh, come on, they don't drive!
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
Price club.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
I just need it, that's all.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
So, you're still master of your domain.
Mint?
Uh, Swiss.
Uh, did you?
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Hey!
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
(like rainman)"Yeah! heading home."
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
Youre not going to wear this.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
That's it.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
Sorry.
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
You guys ready?
Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
Well, yeah.
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
You got any shredded coconut?
Dark blue.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
What do you mean?
All of it. You want to invest?
What, she's been away?
"How?"
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
Our rickshaw?
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
What's a Chow Fung?
All right George, come on, take a look.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
I thought we would blend in.
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
(shaking hands) Yeah.
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
He jumped.
He's spaced out.
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Remember I told you about the bank?
AH! I don't want her disturbed.
"You should take cold showers."
Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
I told ya.
Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?
I don't know...
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
Ah, Yeah. uh...
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
What test?
No, no I can't comprehend it?
All right, I'll see you guys.
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
(smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
Youre flesh and blood.
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Uhummm...
The AC is on it's way.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
I got a stone.
AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
Ma?
Turn on the TV.
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
Yeah? Eva?
Hey, how about that Toby, huh?
Uh, well, there's someone else.
Hey!! Frank just called me. Congratulations.
(lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
Ooooh I like Ring Dings.
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
Really?
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
But it's Festivus.
Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
So how's George?
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
Well, we'll have to improvise.
Uh.
hey
You are one sick mama I like it.
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
Any mustard? This is empty.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
Naomi, come on let's get goin'.
Yea, last night.
I told you I sold them to Bania.
I, I saw her naked.
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
All right, get off at the next exit.
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
It will be a funky adventure.
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
You better believe it.
But this'll get you around?
Can I get in on that?
(Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Now what's with you?
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
Are too.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
You get to make your own pie!
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
Yeah, stir it up so it melts.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
Really?
Hey! George.....Lily..
(whimper) Jerry?
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Well, that's weird.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
OK, OK-
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
I bet.
You got that straight!
Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
Oh yeah, she's fantastic....
What about her?
(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
So you don't know where you got 'em?
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
What's the matter?
Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
You got that right!
I thought we had a deal?
Oh, yeah.
Gu-gu- cada-
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
Are you through?
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
My old one sprung a leak.
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
What?
I'm very happy with this.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
Yeah.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
Taste this.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
(claps hands) So ...
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Well I suppose the children do.
Hey.
Who are you talkin about?
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
(acting standoffish) Hello.
He begged me.
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
I told you I was gonna get it.
How come?
Elaine
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?
Alright, c'mon!
Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
Meet, the bro.
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
(shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
What?!
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
What guy?
Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
Hi.
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?
Well, this is a surprise ha?
"Lets share.. we share....Awight"
"(gasp_)......Kom Pau........"
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
Right.
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
Yeah.
First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
These street toughs, they robbed me.
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
Nestl's Quik!
Yeah. me neither.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
"yeah, yeah, lets do that."
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
So long. I'll see you tonight.
Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?
No.
I think so too.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
A sweat shop.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
"So... Did you take a look?"
Uh-huh.
(surprise) What?
Hey, Georgie.
(quietly, to himself) Look at this.
Yeah, but I prefer the bro.
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
Disaster.
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Uh, you need any help, or..?
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
I have no concentration!
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
I'm in here. C'mon...
Ya.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
Awright, hands up, porky!
Yeah, she dumped me!
Polio?
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
Bad news, my friend.
I told you she liked me.
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Bro!
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
But where does the meat go?
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
Okay, what do you got?
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
What do you think?
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Double?
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Yep.
Well, don't look at me.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
No, don't, don't make me
Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
Talk to me baby.
I don't know where the tops are.
Well, you should, Jerry.
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
The little man knows all.
Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
Hey.
(mocking) Too bad you got engaged.
Well so she faked 'em, so what?
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
And?
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
Have we been intimate?
Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Run, run! Go, go, go!
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
Open it, it's from Hallmark.
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Erika, she's Erika
(smiling) Well...
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
I was never able to become a banker.
Well, it's my final offer.
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Mousse. I moussed up.
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
Oh - I'm familiar with it.
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
C'mon , c'mon what's the matter?
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
Paella, ya I'll be there.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Yeah, he was fired.
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
What?s his message like?
No, of course not. (winks back)
I'm in. Let's go for it.
Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Well, why not?
(indicating) You see? You can't let go.
All right....Sit down George.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
Heh.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
No, no, no.
So, huh?
I want my vacuum cleaner!
Not really.
Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
(overly excited) Hey (Claps hands one time)
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
Oh, hey,
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
Well, Happy Festivus.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
But that's not Hello.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
Well, then I was way off!
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
It's just a write off for them.
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.

Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over.
It was on the seat...
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
Hey man, what's going on?

What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
I don't know.
C'mon Seattle, let's go.
I'm the real Peterman.
I know how to handle these psychotics.
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
Hmm.
Um-hm.
Hey.
Oh, yes, I am.
Why not?
Yep yep yep.
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
An In The Park Home Run!
Genderson's.
Yeah.
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
What's this?
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
Oh yeah, coming up...
Let me have her number.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?

Well I came back for you.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Hey! JoJo!
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Oh! Come on.
Well, we're not very close.
Bombs away (Uh oh).
It's just Original, Jerry!
Donna!
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
Will you relax?!
Oh, you have no idea.
(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
Help me Father. Help me.
Oh, that's too bad.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
No. And now I can't get it back.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
Come on, take some. It's good.
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
No, No You said Hey!
Look, let me handle this.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
(shouts) Hey, peanuts!
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
So what?
Newman!
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Yeah, what time is it?
Are you sure you're not pregnant?
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
Anything...
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
(pointing) That's her, officer.
Bania, you're killing me.
Yeah, no kidding.
Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.
Five bucks???
Aah! Aah! Mama!
Oh yeah right it's raining.

Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
Yeah, it's a windshield.
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
Hey! Jerry!
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
Well if they're lucky.
Oh, these are nice corners, huh?
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
And go we will.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
Jerry? Jerry!
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
...Okay, yes, shoot.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Uh, you remember my coffee table book?
(enters) Well.
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Oh, yeah?
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Hes a go getter!
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
No, no, I got it.
I don't know!
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
I'm doin' fine.
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
Wheehh
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
(low tone) All right.
I'll pick her up.
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
Just get some gum or something.
hey
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
So THAT's how it's going to be
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
What do you mean?
I always put you up here...
Hey.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.
All right, I'll take Julie.
(to baby) Koochie koochie koochie koo

Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
I've made an important life decision.
(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
We're putting in cable.
Oh, conversion rate, oh.
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.

Lindsay olives, Jerry.
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Me neither.
You got a dog?
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
We're making sausages.
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
When do you pit the sauce on?
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
(dismissive) Yeah.
She's fat.
Hey, see, I like it like this.
Hey!
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
No, I got a girl in the next building
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
And it could be done.
I thought we were friends...
Euh what...What lot is that?
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
Well, what's the matter?
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
Hey.
Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
(to Jerry) Hey, howd you do?
Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
No, blame me.
I think she liked me.
It's just...it's no picnic.
Oh, I, I need a pen.
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.
(laughing) He he, yeah.
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
All right, lets go.
Okay, who wants meatloaf?
Hey, Jerry.
So, what do you think?
No, I want to speak to the manager.
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
We could be tried for murder...
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
Well, I'm off to the links.
Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)
Yeah, that def jam is a force.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
That's... even better!
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
Oh, we have to do this now.
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
Well did you mention my name?
(pleased) Really?
I like that eye patch.
No.
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
Yeah.
Have you seen George?
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
Yeah, nice to meet you.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
Cosmo Kramer.
What?
Yeah, me, too.
(stops Mickey) Alright, come on.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
What's the matter? You've got a cold?
Well, you can't leave now.
Is it? Look at this.
Oh I'm down.

Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
(not understanding him) Hey, thanks.
Why?
Oh...no.
Ok!
Oh, they were Chemical.
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Well, thats a weird thing to say
Huh? Yeah.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Nobody put a gun to your head.
Who is it?
Wha-huh-wha-huh...
That kid...
Well I won them anyway.
Elaine?
Where do I know that guy from?
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
You should just eat fruit.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
Yeah, well he started it.
I don't have it, I threw it out.
uptown, to the Y
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
I'm puttin it on
Yeah.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
well it just doesn't sit well.
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
Oh? How do you figure?
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
George says "Cut it."
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
How did this happen?
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
She made an offer. I took it.
I'm sorry.
No no. Its all in my head.
Well at least there's no traffic.
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
I sure am.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
Yes, that's my contention.
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
Oh, he's the best...and the worst.
What's that red dot on your sweater?
Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
Just show me the cheque, c'mon.
you know I think you are in love with him
I tell you.
I thought I heard you.
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
Barry?
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!
Well, you're going over there.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
Jerry, you forgot your purse.
Call him and tell him
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
Yeah, well, that was a good one.
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
Watch out, boy.
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
Hello, I'm Kramer.
What do you mean?
Fix what?
that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
Hey.
Oh, well, thank you.
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!
yeah yeah, (in a flinty voice) flinty
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
"No,No...You were here first."
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Its over four hundred?
I don't know it's up to you.
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
You're not pregnant?

He's holistic, George. He's holistic.
Now calm down, Mr. Fields...
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
Do you have any prospects?
You have to know everything, don't you?
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.

There was no plan.
Yeah, a player...
Hey what again?
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
Jerry!
She's got a kid?
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
But she really looks like a Lily
Well no, I don't have them on me.
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
pig-man, baby. pig-man.
Yes, yes I am.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
Yeah.
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.
Ya, you have any others?
Hey.
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
My job. What are you doing?
(clueless) what is what?
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
Lets go get him.
Heads up!
I'm gonna eat that later.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Huh?
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
You killed them, didn't you?
Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
No, Jerry!
It was an accident.
I'm fried.
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Alright, but no bites.
What?
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
This ramp is steep.
(quiet) Oh.
Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
I'd like to get some coffee.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
Quone. To quone something.
You better get the door.
Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
So you don't think it's a good idea?
Hey, sorry I'm late.
(He shows her) This umpf thing.
Oh. What about?
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
My mom Babs.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
Oh, God.
It was in my laundry.
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Hey, watch where you're kicking!
Spleenectomy.
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Well that's stupid
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
Shell-shocked?
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
Yeah, all right.
What time does that play start?
What?
Would you like a refund?
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
Well, I was just--
Do it. Do it. This.
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Well you can go to your room and read.
Hey.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Oh, guess again, Tubby!
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
(dismissive) Ahh.
Defective.
I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.
Who?
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
What is it?
Oh.
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
So how much are we gonna make?
Well I don't, I'm guessing.
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Phew.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
No, taste it. Taste it.
Yeah. Sure. Sure.
Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
Well, I like yours.
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
Newman?
Cmon, George. I saw it first.
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
Well, you won't regret it.
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
What about a big sponge?
How often do you cut your toe nails?
Mickey Mantle.
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
What?
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
He's a happy camper huh?
So, what do you think? Does this work?
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
(low tone) All right, yeah.
Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
What is that?
Stop right there.
No, they never heard of him.
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
It's very refreshing!
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
Who died?
Newman, wait!
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
Oh, I'll be back.
Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!
Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
It's like ten dates in one shot.
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
Want any help?
Alright, I'm down.
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Yeah, about two hours.
Aahh, this looks familiar
Ya I told you.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
What?
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
Come on, let's go to the beach.
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
You didn't get the blood from me.
Hey.
I have a pen.
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
HELLO!
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
So...
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
What would be the point in taking the water?
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
And yet, he's my friend.
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
All right, geez. You're crazy.
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
George, you gonna buy a painting?
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
So what's up, Diggity Dog?
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
Unh.... Sorry.
Yeah that's right.
Oh.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
Gimme your credit card.
Yeah...
(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
Davola?
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
Feel it. Feel it.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
I will lose that nail.
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
Hey, eh, Lew!
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
It's Kramer!
Come on JUST TASTE!!!
Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
"They're Plyometric.(sp?)"
Got any Double Crunch?
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
What, did you ask her?
Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
Uh huh.
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
Two and a half points.
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Well, I'm not giving it back.
(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
They moved in together?
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
It's an eyepatch.
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
Ah!
Do over  start with him.
It's got to be here.
(quietly) yeah.
How do those lifts feel?
Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
Yeah, I bought a chicken.
Hey!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Oh, Ill be comfortable.
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
Fungi.
EVIL, eye.
It's pronounced thermometer.
No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
oh that wouldn't be very good
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
O'Brien.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
Ok.
Uh huh
Hey, I told you.
Pretty good, huh?
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Do you want more pastrami?
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
But I'm tired..
Well, where's the soup?
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
I don't like her.
George, we got a problem.
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
What's that smell?
Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
Hey, is that T-bone?!
Hey.
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
I'm Cosmo.
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
I don't know about that outfit though.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
Hmm-mmm.
Oh, no you don't.
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
I guess she was hot.
Because I don't have a table.
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
A couple of hours ago.
I thought you said she stinks
Yeah!
City or highway?
Oh?
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
GO! GO!!
That's right. He's a troublemaker.
hello
No! Don't!
Maybe that's what he's got.
What?
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Beg me.
Ow
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
what?
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
Hey.
Right.
Its for you.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
Well, It's quite a thrill.
(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!
Hey.
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
Yeah.
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
Hey.
Alright, I'll call her right now.
Ooh, I like that.
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
What's the matter with him?
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
"What d'you got there?"
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
(Confused) What?
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
Done!
MUST be banker.
Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!
Who's that?
Yeah.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..
Uh, Pantene.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Excuse me.
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...
Yeah, youre the punk Im looking for!
Well, can you call him an ambulance?
Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!
Well, we'll see.
No.
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
What about my massage?
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
His mudda' was a mudda'.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
Ah ha!
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
I'm not going if he's going.
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Hey, what's going on?
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
(rips open package) Yeah, that's...
YAH! (exits)
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
Gail Cunningham.
You can have this one.
Oooooh ...Pops .... Wow!! Spectacular.
Yea.
Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
Wha, you too?
Oh Movie Phone.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
"Well.. Aye can't hold the water."
Sister Roberta.
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
Yeah. Where's yours?
What happened?
No, they're good! Take one..
Eh! Come on. What did you say?
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
I went back with Ellen.
Oohh.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
(claps hands) Yes indeed.
(chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
So now, what's this got?
Well, thank you.
What's going on?
Yes
It's this way.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
So, how you feeling?
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Well it's muffin stumps
That's right.
When can you park head first?
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
(opening the fridge) Sayonara.
So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
All right, I'll see you later.
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
(to Mickey) You know? She's right.
Right!
yep.
You said it, sister.
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
They got you too?
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
Yeah?
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Well, you're pregnant.
Does George know?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
I got it. Yep.
Right by her!
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
There's no problem, really.
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
A dry-cleaning bill for what?
He's ripping me off
He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.
Hey, did that guy show up?
Great.
Hey.
Jeez!
Like the big toe captain..
You weren't even married yet.
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
You know I'm in that movie?
Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
"HEY I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!!!"
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
Wha? Where?
I'm goin' to Newman's!
Equivalency.
Well what are you doing here?
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
(being grabbed by the security officials) Hey!
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Hey.
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Where you going?
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
You dont?
No. He doesn't know.
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Just take one.
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
Well, thank you.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
Oh?
Oh, he's a dunker.
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
Woah, you didn't like her?
Yeah, morning.
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
Well I don't remember that part.
Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
I'll do it.
You know, I think you're jealous.
(Interested) That's perfect.
All right.
Over three hundred?
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
I must know.
got problems Jerry.
Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
I'm down.
Five minutes. What?
I know.
Really, Ah,
Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
Oh, yow, oow Ah!
Yeah..
Ah, people in this city are crazy.
Well, maybe I did overextend myself.
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
How much?
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
I sure am.
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
I'm sorry Jackie.
ahh.....!!
Hey boss.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
So...how was the dinner last night?
I cant believe hes in a coma.
I'm getting my pot.
Uh, yeah.
Okay...yea well uh start with me.
Yeah.
Jer.
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.
She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
Where are they?
Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)
Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.
Whatever it takes.
(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha.
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Hey! Couch is comin.'
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
George, do me a solid? Two minutes.
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
What are you doing to yourself?
Huh?
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
...sluggish.
Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
Hey, what's going on?
Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
Hey.
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
Oh? Who's Leo?
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Jerry too, of course.
My stuffed cabbage!
Come on, Larry. You know me.
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
They're never in contention.
You can move in with me, if you want.
Oh, stop saying 'reneging".
Come on, try it on.
Oh yeah, you betcha.
What about Jerry?
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
Why?
Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.
I want to talk to Calvin.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
Yeah, yeah, I know him.
A picture.
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
I know what I'm gonna say.
(playing with his hair) Talk to him.
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
"Yes sweep."
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Yes I am.
That's what they gave me.
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
I told you this is all I got.
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
Did you offer those guys a drink?
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
Alright I'll get a blender.
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
(to George) Hey buddy.
I may be old, but I'm spry.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
Brown?
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
Don't really remember.
Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?
What?
No. Don't, Jerry.
Well, get him to bark.
There were 1,650 survivors.
Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Roger that.
Getting something to eat.
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
Well, thank you.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
Y'aah!
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
I got it! This time, I got it!
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
Good luck with that.
Oh. Hello.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
Jerry, George!
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
(intrigued) Really?
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
(quietly) Hey, Jerry.
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
Deal?
Maybe I will.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
Can you give him a cookie?
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
I'm going upstairs.
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.
Oh, you better believe it!
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
Yeah.
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Relax, he does that all the time.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
(Definite) Cigars.
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
Oh You are so freaking talented.
Huh?
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Yeah.
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.
What? You're siding with management?!
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
Wait, wait, wait...
Hey.
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Oh, Mama.
Okay.
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
I don't want this on my conscience.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
I'm good for it.
No no no, well, then who was it?
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
(entering Monk's) Hey, you guys.
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
Yeah.
You drank a whole bottle of water.
Alright.
Hips! See, its all hips.
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
Hello!
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
What?!
That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!
They should be sent to Australia.
You are a lover boy!!
Hi guys.
Jerry, George got arrested.
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.
What?
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
Because we're blind to their tyranny.
Shut up! I'll get my coat!
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
Elaine?
You just gotta mention my name.
What am I gonna say?
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
Oh I'll take these.
No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
Hi, Mike.
It's me!
What's happenin' here?
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Okay, I beg you.
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
I got time.
Hey, how you doin'?
Y-Yeah, all right.
Yeah let me borrow your scarf.
I know how to sign.
No. No It's Lily
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
Aahh...Who's Janet?
Yeah. That's strange.
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
Nothin.'
(to George) Yeah!
Vandelay.
He's my caddy.
Hey.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
I can't ...
What do you mean?
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
What about the baby?
You wanna go get him?
Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
Because he's scared, Jerry.
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
Yeah.
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
It felt like 8 seconds.
(as he leaves with it) Crackers.
Pass the cream.
George, we're sorry.
Why?
The name on the boat. Look at it.
I won't!
Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
"Hi Gwen, hi tide."
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
Come on, one lap around.
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
Hey, how ya doing?
Hey, you got any matches?
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
Lyndon Johnson.
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
Habla espanol?
He's in jail.
Yea.
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Go ahead smell, smell
That's NBC.
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
We'll see you later...
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
(whistles) What's he like huh?
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Bet? Um, not betting.
(leaving) Aw.
Didn't we come in over there?
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Yes!
I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead.
Yeah.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
Are too.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Yeah.
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.
Oh
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
I I I
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
Well, I was just trying to help out.
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
I'm so tired!
Hey.
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
What, youre not gonna tell me?
I'll show ya Rusty.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Hey...
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Hi, little buddy.
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
I wouldn't walk over there.
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
Yeah.
(in pain) Ow! Jeez!
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Hey.
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
Oh, gees...
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
Serenity now, serenity now...
No, I fled the scene.
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
Yeah.
Jackie we gotta talk.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
Okay.
(abruptly) Well, I'll see you.
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
Just gonna find out if he's interested.
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
Okay.
Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
You got any of those mini Ritzes?
They want to know why they never see you.
What are you all dressed up for?
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
Me?
(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
All right then, what was it?
let go, hey grab the rock
Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
Because Im a pod?
Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
C'mon Jerry!
Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
I don't know.
And..voila!
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
What's going on?
Fungus.
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Rusty! Rusty!
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
Uhm...
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
Alright, where you going?
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
Hey, George what are you doing here?
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
Hi
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Yello?
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.
Ooh Mama...( walks away)
Yes, that's true.
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
Got any coffee?
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
I found it on the road.
Why doesn't he just move in here?
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Right here at the mall.
"Eh!! Cosmo Kramer. Nice to meet you"
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
Would you?
(off camera) Are we getting this?
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
All right, What about the money?
How come you never said anything?
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
Awe, alright
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Help me!! Help me!
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
That's better than we estimated.
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
(points) Digidi.
Whoa!
Sell it, just say Im selling!
(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
Huh?
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
Why not? hey what about you George?
Why?
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
And you're going to go out with her.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
I like mangos.
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
What's up?
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
Yo
What? What?
What?
Oh, I'm the real deal.
Hey, Elaine scratch my back.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
My Little Jerry! (Runs out.)
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
Ch- oo-... what?
Hey!
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
Um, Uh, ugh, ...
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
Yeah, see how you're singing?
Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
You've been married three times.
Are they war veterans?
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
That's nice..
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
What?
Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
(proffering) Here, try this pair.
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.
Well, that's classified.
"HEY TAXI!!!.....TAXI!!"
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
Yeah, yeah.
Really?
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
You scream good.
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
Have you ever met my guys?
The only way to fly.
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
What?
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
You shut up!
Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
If only I could say things like that around her.
Yowza yowza. Check it out.
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
Well, he's still a conductor.
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
Oh. I'll lug.
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
See, that's why I don't want to.
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Well, more bad news Jerry.
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
No. They put the top on.
Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
Mama!
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
Hey, that's supposed to be great.
Why, what's the difference?
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
And you're saying she's deaf.
That's the idea.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Hey.
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Oh I can be quite litigious.
There you go monkey boy.
Because we're engaged.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.
(RE CAR) I found it!
Yeahh. I owe you one.
Yeah, here it is... yeah.
Yeah, that's right. You did.
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Oh, he's cold.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
The coffee was too hot.
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
The monkey.
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
Hey.
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
A mouse!
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Is your name Ray?
(puzzled) Phone call?
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
$17.50. You can't beat that.
How about Idi Amin, huh?
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
I take baths.
"What? You're crazy."
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
Hey, George, stick 'em up.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
Y'hello.
My name's Kramer.
(a bit startled) Ahh.
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
Gonorrhea!
Did you see that guy?
How could you not think about it?
Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.
Yeah.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
Hey.
Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?
(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.
Oh... yeah...
Are you guys ready?
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
(backing off) OK.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
"Oh yes, yes indeed."
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
Go ahead, drink it, George.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Hello.
Does your girlfriend have to be here?
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
Oh, thank you.
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
No, it didn't say anything.
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
Well then, what did you do next?
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
No, that's yours. My half is gone.
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Yeah.
(smelling) What's burning?
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
Ah!
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
Yey eye ca-catfight.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
Yeah, don't I know it.
Hey.
"There's no candy around here. hey! Jimmy."
My god, you're rich.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
Hahaa!
Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
[OC] THE BEACH!!!
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
Yeah.
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.
Hey.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
Oh yeah, yeah.
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
Uh-huh.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
what about?
L'Occupado.
Jerry . . .
That's true.
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
Are you kidding me?
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
What did this guy do? What happened?
(Pleading) I was all dirty!
Oh, hello.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Awe check it out.
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
Hey, Silvio!
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
Yeah -- yeah.
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
You see?
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
Yeah.
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Uh huh.
Yeah. Open it.
Ooh! Remember Poppie?
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
Sure. I will.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
Ah!!! Yahh!!!
Well, then, he's out!
(Stretching) Oh..
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
Huh! You make a higher roof.
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Yes!
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
Vaguely.
(looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.
Where can I put this?
What's in the deep end?
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Newman!
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Hello.
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
More? More than three thousand?
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
(putting on the lotion) Ya
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
Big mistake.
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
Steven.
You got that straight.
There's no water pressure.
Well, how did they get your face?
Naw ,na , that's no good.
Ya.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
He just sunk like a stone.
No, no, no.
Hey.
(Struggling) Hey!
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
Yeah.
Gawd!!!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
(from outside) Hello?
Well, Ill think of something.
Umas number is on that ticket.
Yeah. How'd it go?
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
Well, I don't know what to do man!
I'll just squeeze in...
Alright, how often do we do it?
We'll see you Dwayne.
Ive gotta feed the birds.
Thats as good as anything you do.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
Hey!
(Getting Pulled and pulled) I...um...ei...
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
Hey.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
Ja ja ja - just tell it
When you getting it back?
I thought it was here.
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
No.
I said how come it's takin' so long?
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
"BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING."
(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?
So, you up next?
Huh?
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
Yeah. See ou later..
Doc, huh?
Alright, I'm gonna see you later.
Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
A stall man, huh? (small laugh)
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
(waving) Shellbach.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
What, they don't like me?
Yeah!
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Yeah, maybe not technically, but
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Woah, Nelson!
Yo-yo Ma!
well she says Jane
Don't be a fool.
Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?
Do you have a woman?
Getting some cereal
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
"You've got something between your teeth"
Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
Oh, well I have many associates.
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
'bout what?
Why not?
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
You keep him busy.
People do, I don't.
[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...
Yeah yeah yeah.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
Yyyeeaaah!!
Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
(Squirming) Jerry! What?!
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Ah, you're making too much of it.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
If you like her, go talk to her.
The woman is a menace.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
(to Jerry) Hey buddy.
Hey.
I want to capture this.
What?
What'd you get for it?
...All right ..Starting now......
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
It's terrible!
Nope. No good.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
Yeah, he was.
What?
Very... much...
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
No, I got dibs!
I'll bring back the pot.
(shuts door) "Bailing"?
You got butchered.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Oh yeah? What about?
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
No way I'm taking fifteen.
Woah, that's quite a honk!
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Oh, we go back a ways.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Bye!!
Yeah.
I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
Yeah.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies.
You called me?
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
No.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
Ah, you remember.
Maybe I outta go over there.
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
(clattering inside) That wasn't me!
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
You gave up the voice?
Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)
Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.
(To Driver) Hey, let me drive.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
Levels.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Yeah. That's Rusty.
Yeah.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
Yayaya...
Hey buddy! Hey!
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
Well, I gotta do somethin'.
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Ooooh... You stink.
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
yeah
Yippie-yi-yay!
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
This mango is delicious!
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
Yeah. What dog?
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
No no no. End of the month.
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
You can get that in your arms?
I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
Come on. Are you sure?
Eh! Bingo.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Are too.
If they're real, that's Rushdie.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
These are great seats huh?
Because of the coffee thing?
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
yeah!
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Oh, hey.
Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?
I'm off hot water.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
Haircut.
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
So, you sleep in separate beds.
They're right out here.
What state?
Uh, no, no, not yet.
(softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale.
Well, I can't!
Well I got it!
He is just setting the record straight.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
Oh, it's a birthday card.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
Oh, I'm with him.
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
Well they gotta be soft.
I need to talk to you.
No, I swear.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Break up with her
Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.
Whats this?
Hey.
Yeah.
Oh, memory burn.
I'm Kramer.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Tuesday? Uh...
Be realistic George.
Sendrax.
Hey, you got any Double Crunch?
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
Oh, boy.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
All right, c'mon, let's go again.
Not THAT hot.
Yeah!!
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
What dog?
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
God!
Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
Retail is for suckers.
Oh, that's my phone.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
That's a nipple.
(does a double take) It's too busy
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
Arrest?
Jerry, you gotta help me!
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
Hey!
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
I don't know.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
A pig-man. Half pig, half man!
Hey, everything my man.
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Awright, my work is done here.
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
What are the chances of that?
Oh, hey, hi buddy.
(doing the voice) La la la.
That's fine.
(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
Ge--
Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
Yeah
Hey.
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Can you do that for me, buddy?
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
Quiet, quiet.
Hey you!
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
It's Pagliacci!
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
Whats to think about?
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
You got a pen?
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Git.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
Hi.
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
What?
I too am well.
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
Easy Mickey, easy.
Hey, McNab!
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Oh come on, You can tell me.
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
And to the bathroom.
Uh, 42.
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
Unbelievable.
I can't believe I didn't see it.
I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm)
Jerry, what is your problem?
(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
Yeah.
That was alright.
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
What is this, oregano?
Well, that's a little strange.
Yeah.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
I'm in here. How's it going.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
Yes, yes! You said it!
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
What about Sundays and holidays?
She quit.
So...you're the Assman.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
Hey. These are for you Olive.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
You just answered your own question.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Is that a problem?
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
(pause) YEAHH!
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
Who?
It's not illegal.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
Uh-huh.
She didn't have any?
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Ahh.
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
Hey.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Yeah I could have helped you out.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
How you doing? (Kramer leaves)
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
Yeah.
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
You gonna throw this out?
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
Thanks, buddy.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
Conceivably.
oh... (goes to the bedroom)
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
Frank!
(mumbles and leaves)
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
OH! GOD HELP US!!!
(Declaring) I'm out!
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, right...
And she doesn't know anything, about this?
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
Just a little burning during urination.
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Rock.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
hell-oo
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
I got a quality.
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
George is saying "Cut it."
-ca.
Uh, yeah, ah ...
Hey
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
I can't work with these!
What?
The *beach*!
Really.
What do you mean, a broad noodle?
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Yeah.
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
Well, you're not reading it now.
You cooked?
Yea, yea.
Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Uh, no thanks.
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
I got a line in the movie!
You're *not*!!!
(Wiggling and floppin) Pull Down
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
What?
YAOH!
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
Right.
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
Which one?
Yeah, put these glasses on.
Hey, hey.
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
Oh.
Wow.
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
A big phone. A big one.
Elaine?
How could you?
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
I got it at Joes.
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
yeah
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
I wouldnt set foot in your house.
It was about 1200 bucks.
Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
What ever turns you on.
Hey! You're back!
Hey, what are you doing?
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
You know who you are? Even Steven
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
Well, he started it!
No, no. She put a stop to that.
What's doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
So, is everything cool? or what?
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Sure Mrs. Anvino, ya.
Yeah, so?
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?
No.
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
OH! I got to call her back.
You don't say?
Hey.
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
No paper?
Hello?
Hey! Mike!
Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.
Well, why no T-bone?!
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
What's an extremity?
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
Ohhhh, what's this?
Hey, well, this is Sally.
How's that feel?
Commando 8 has arrived!
The tobacco companies.
Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
Thats okay. He doesnt care.
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Yeah.
Oh yeah she's a beauty.
I'm calling Jerry.
Can't help ya, kid.
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
What?
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Hi Mr. Clotworthy
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
Want some mango?
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
There they are.
Yeah.
Newman! Newman!!
Well, would I be able to communicate?
Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Hey!
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
Didnt Elaine call you?
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
You? You're getting old.
Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
So I, I didn't do anything wrong.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
Neither are you.
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
Well, that's good news.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
No chance in hell!
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Wha--
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Yeah, I'm an extra.
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
Yeah.
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
That's right.
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.
Hey.
(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!
Cause Im getting rid of it.
Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
(does a double take) Yikes.
(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
Another Festivus miracle!
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Why? What wa?
Double or nothin'.
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
Keflon.
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
"So what's wrong with that?
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
You know Frank, you could take a break.
Ya I didn't know you could cook.
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
That you Bobby?
Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
You know you're going to.
Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
(immaturely) I guess.
Yes.
Oh yeah (quietly)
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Yeah. All right one chart coming up.
Hey.
Yeah, hi Elaine.
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
We played Backgammon in the nude.
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
Forget it.
Seventy -five bucks a month!
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
Alright, what size are you?
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
"Ohhh H'am loaded."
All right
Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?
Boy...
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
Hey, what's he doin'?
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
I just assume not sit next to you.
Jerry, he probably had a cold.
(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
That smell. What's that smell?
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
Uh, habla ingles?
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
What am I supposed to say?
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Whoh!
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Oh.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
make me an offer.
Rock.
Hey, you seen the paper yet?
Ok.
Huh? I don't?
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
I'll tell you how much I make.
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
Raquel Welch!
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
I don't even really work here!
Yeah, your phone is line one.
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
To the whole scene. (sniff)
No, we're in the same class.
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
Just drive.
What tonight?
Uh, Varnsen.
Well, I'd say it nicely.
That's queer uh?
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Oh, hey.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
Not just someone. Jon Voight.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
It changes the molecules.
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
I'm shaving with it.
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
What? What? What? Tell me.
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
You got the paper yet?
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
No. It belongs to the British.
What's that?
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.
Why not?
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
What?
I say Japan.
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
Heyy! Look who's here.
Is that seat taken?
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
I wanna see it.
(cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
South America?
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
Well, that guy who yelled out.
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
(puzzled) I think so.
Come on ,Just take a taste
Well, yeah...
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Yeah.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
You're moving to California?
I thought you said it was a scratch.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
All right, let's go.
Oooow! He's biting me!
They're trying to screw with your head.
That's good thinking.
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
But you *will* use... a retractor.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
Well, I know what they feel like.
Hey.
Whoa, you're dating this woman?
She says she wants those shoes.
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
Me too.
Yeah--
Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
Hey.
(quietly) Um-hm.
Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
Yeah-
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
Of what?
Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?
Really?
I'll break.
Really? Feels like Tuesday.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
But I did sit in mud.
What banking?
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
Power, man. Power.
I'm in love.
You should sleep with him.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
Ooh tattle tale
Uh, yeah.
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
Alright you go ahead.
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst...
Whe have the same symptoms.
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
Why don't you just give up?
You always tell it ..
Its beautiful.
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
(not convincing) Uh, yeah.
Joes?
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
Well it's 555-3455.
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
Hey, what's going on?
T-t-t-t...
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
Where? Where?
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
He's quite a character, isn't he?
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
Uh-huh.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
Well, why don't you do your material?
What?
What, this is a party?
You did.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
Yeah!
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
Well, I beg to differ...
No, no, I'm working on it.
Poor Lily..
"What?"
Yeah. Well, he's a dear.
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
No, I didn't see him.
(somewhat under his breath) Ya ya.
What?
HUAAHHH!!
I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
Alright.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
That's correct.
Hey.
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
Cigars? (hits the box)
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
yeah
How much do you make?
Yeah.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
Well, you'd better take it easy.
Course I will. These are staples.
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
Jerry this peach is sub par.
Me?
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
What happened here?
Well let's sit down.
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
What's that?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
Where?
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
Hey! They hooked me up.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Well,
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
What happened?
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
I got them too.
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
It's Jell-O.
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
What's so funny? ... wha?
Relax, Silvio.
hey
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
Tryin' to save a quarter.
I go in front first all the time.
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
Hey.
Psst. Hey.
I'm asking you!
What happened?!
For you he would.
No, I dunno how much duty is.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
"Hey! Got the new Penthouse"
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
(reading) sobs
New cards, huh?
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
Why not?
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
No, not these. These were real hooters.
How long are you staying?
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
Do I smell?
the rock
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
That's right.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
(opening a card) Oh, a check.
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
I don't wanna go back on there!
What about him?
Wait a second....
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Well, now I can't see Jerry.
He wants to talk.
Yeah.
(approving) Yeah.
Hey.
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
(quietly) Hey Jerry.
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
On the signal, George. On the signal.
Oh my!
Cash.
Huh?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, I snuck a peak.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
Yeah.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
You can't get a stool in here.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
No.
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
Done.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
Hey.
Oh, uh, well - okay.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hey.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
(Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
What, you're giving him this suit?
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
I may have to drive that place out of business.
1937.
Yeah, a different one.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry.
Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
Hey, he's a terrific guy.
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
I didn't even know they were defective.
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
it was your fault
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
Ouch!!..........Now!!
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
I got fired from the movie.
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
(unbelieving) I can have this?!
Hey buddy.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
"Boy , you're looking sharp there Tim."
Well open the door, you get a better look.
Is that from Henry the Eighth?
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
Hey.
Oh, you don't remember me.
Mine, too. I got one more day.
Remember this?
Hey.
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
10-4.
Ashtrays?
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Hey.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
That musta been some kind of doll.
Oh, so he took you back.
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
She has delicate beauty.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
Oh, hey, how you doing?
Oh, come on.
I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Hey! Anybody home? Oh boy.
Giddy-up!
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
Sure you have.
What else?
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Yeah.
Hey.
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
What is this, parsley?
Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.
Can't hear a thing.
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.
It's just me.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
He's the *phone* man!
I put them on a dental chair.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Clear blue sky!
They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
Ok, it's forgotten.
Oh...yeah!
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
Yeah, merry Christmas.
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
Yeah that's right.
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
Uh, Cosmo Kramer?
Nothin'
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
Let me talk to Calvin.
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
what?
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
She kissed me back.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
uh..
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Hey buddy.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
he asked me
Yes!
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Well, he can't be disturbed now.
Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
Well, is it good?
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
Well, they're slim-fit.
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
Hey, Brody!
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)
Yeah... I do great, yeah.
Okay. What are you getting?
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
Yeah?
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Hey, buddy!
Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
"Yeah"
Huh?
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
Talkin' to that woman.
(positive) That makes me the premiere.
What?
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
I live for Merlot.
No, it doesn't work.
Better get that
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
Elaine!
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
From you?
...I didn't say that, no.
All right, all right, come on, now.
You're all right
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
I thought we were talking about me.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
Which one?
You got that straight.
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
Ooh! !Dios mio!
Yeah.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
Yeah (again quietly)
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
Well there ought to be ball men.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
(makes his pop sound) There you go.
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
Are you still on the pill?
What?
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
You've got a message buddy.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Ohhh!
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
What is going on here?
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Hey hold that bus!
Oh, like you're gonna stop?
Oh, I get by.
Yeah.
Potato man!
Mmm... Nice wallet.
Those people, listen to yourself.
I can't I can't
Well, I don't know what to do.
He's a genius. Here we go...
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
They just write it off.
What, did they kick you out too?
No job. No women.
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
I'm not, I'm running it.
You don't think so.
He's gonna make us very happy.
I'm watching your door.
Why?
Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
Pine is good.
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
You got cigars, huh.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
Oh now you don't want my business.
What, you took a cab?
Hey you got it.
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
O'Brien? Well that's weird.
(to George) What's with you?
C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.
Then I'll be back.
Yeah, go ahead.
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
You got anything on the horizon?
Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
Oh I'll be up for it punk.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Nothing.
Well, just save me a seat.
Well, he didn't say (leaves).
Oh no, I don't think so.
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
That's for radiation.
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
I got carpool. (exits)
No.
You got any pliers?
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
Because it doesn't concern you.
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
What?
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
No.
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
"So, you're heading home?"
Why are we slowing down?
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!
I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
All righty...
Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
What's wrong?
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
Yeah.
He's very generous, isn't he?
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
So I'd like to give it to you.
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Hey! (moving a chair onto the set)
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
(enters apartment) Hey.
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
Oh, yeah?
September third.
Oh yeah - oui oui.
Take me where? Where?
I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
All right
You're scared of Elaine?
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!
No, five. But you were close.
No kidding.
No, no, I'm off that.
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
(interested) Well, how do you do?
When we went to dinner the other night.
How bout me, Jackie?
So, what are you saying?
Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?
What, they drove to a dealership?
Well, this is Kramer.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Oh, hey!
(hesitant) Uhm...
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
What happened to Newman?
Oh, I gotcha (clicks)
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
All right, everybody! I'm back!
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
Is too.
YAH! No Buts
All right, listen. I need some cash.
Yeah...
Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
George I told you we're booked!
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
Ohh!
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
And?
All right it's done.
Well, I guess I was..
(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
I know where I?m standing.
Yeah (to buzzer)
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
The machine. You want one?
Hey! Elaine..
Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
Hes in the music business.
She said she'll do it.
(Thinks) No, I don't think so.
I gotta find another shower.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
Wait, wait, wait...
No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Ah, I got it.
I get that too. (exits)
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Well, yeah.
Come on...
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
Yeesh-jip!
Pffft - wrong.
Lock and load.
(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.
This hallway smells like potatoes.
Thank you.
Well, I'm a poppa.
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
Yep. (Mumbles off)
Yeah.
Hi. How are you?
Maybe I will.
Oh. Cotton Dockers!
No, I got 'em in the ocean.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna.
Yeah. (Exits)
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
Oh, geez..
(seeing Jerry is with people) Oh.
Well, coffee tables.
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
What, he's not here yet?
well hello Jane
(Confused) What is up with you two?
I've been thinking about something.
Hey.
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
Maestro.
Hey, where's Jerry?
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
Yeah,I had a tough day
Me?
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.
You got it?
Well, I don't want to either.
It's got an alarm that beeps!
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
Yeah.
You're just out for sex!!
Hey.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
Hey, now, they're tough cookies.
Eh!
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
It's macaroni Midler.
(pacing back and forth) Ya.
Look how dark it's gettin' already.
Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?
Hey.
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Jimmy leg.
How's your evening?
(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
What are YOU doing here?
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
Hey, buddy. How was career day?
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
(emotionally) She's deep.
Y'ello?
(Together) Sucker..
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
Since when are you so trendy?
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
Jerry, how about you?
How 'bout zero?
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Oh yeah, you talked to her.
No no look, I was baby-sitting
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
Now what is Executive?
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
"... with a broom, cleaning up."
So now he wants her more than ever!
All right, I'll see you later.
Woah.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
Yeah, something like that.
Who could love me?
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
There you are.
Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?
Independence Day?
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
From pain, will come pleasure.
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing)
I can't taste this.
Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
Well, it's common sense.
No.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry.
Well, maybe it's the Oreos.
Over there. The Dominicans.
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
uuh-
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
NNNN-Giddy-up!
About the opera.
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
Yeah, sure. Please.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, you got a hammer?
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
Ah No no, I haven't.
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
Oh, yeah.
I don't want to!
why can't you make a higher roof.
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
Yeah! Well, are you going out?
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
Ya!
No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
(guiltily) The door.
Quality time.
How tall are you?
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.
Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
Two is better than one.
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
Uh-oh. You're a john.
No. No, he can't do that.
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
(Complaining) No more golf.
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
that's her
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
It was an accident.
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
Get extra MSG.
I am dressed.
What happened?
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
Hmm.
All right, who's down there?
I don't believe that.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Nothin'
Is Elaine going?
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
You got it, buddy.
Oh help me man, I'm desperate!
Hey ah.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
I got mugged.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
Whoa, whoa!!
Mickey!
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
That's weird.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
Hi.
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
Well, why not?
Are you through?
Hey, Elaine.
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
Hey there.
Flea bites?
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
Let me smell you.
His cat's gone.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
Um hm.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Hey.
Don't take my money!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
Yeah, went straight to video.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
Don't blame me.
What whip?
Let me taste it.
I yearn.
Do you like tsimmis?
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
Wide open!
Hey!
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
It was under a spoon!
Then we're cool.
Bennette right?
Why were you holding the door open for?
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
You Gack?
Hey, how's it goin'?
(quiet) Okay.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
There, there's your hives.
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
Hi Todd.
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Kramerica is no more.
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
No.
Yeah, I'll be okay.
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
A bris? You mean circumcision?
I don't know.
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
Hey Maestro!
Oh! yeah.
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Mansiere?
Oh, you're poo-pooing!
How many miles?
Poise. Poise!
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
Hey, you know who owns that car?
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
Smile, everyone! We're back!
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Why? What happened?
Huckleberry.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Yeah, ok.
No. You got a point.
What is what?
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
Well come on George, finish the story.
Hey.
Yes, Sansei.
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
Uh huh, right.
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
You wanna rent a movie?
What's that?
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
Oh here we go--
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
Would you stop it.
Well, doesn't he need that?
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
Well I'm a guest.
I hear you.
Huh?
Good idea.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Yeah, sit, sit, sit Weeell! (laughing, clapping)
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
Aw, you really hurting, huh?
Buddy Hackett?
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
Elaine!
Ooh, cereal bowls.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
No, I got the tape right here.
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Youre a human being.
No, I want to show you.
Yeah. Nice meeting you.
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
What happened?
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
Yeah, how was it?
Oh.
No.
I dont want the levels!
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
Why?
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
Look at this place. It's huge...
Yeah, uh.
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
So, who is your doctor?
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
Oh yeah!
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
She was flouting.
Well, how did this happen?
Any news?
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
Oh I got the ball.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
Hey, man. Enjoy the food?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
My whole lot?
Devola came after me.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
What?
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
Mmm.
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
"My wife has an inner ear infection."
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Never!
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
(Shrugging Jerry off) Nah.
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
Oh, everybody's your type.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
So played.
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Hey
(Making a point) Not everyday.
Yeah!
Aaaahhh...!!!
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
Oh, it's true.
(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!
I told you.
Where's Jerry?
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
What? Where are we going?
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Watch it good.
Yeah.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
What's the problem?
Well, why not.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
I've always wanted to see this.
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Y'know, art's a great investment.
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
(To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?
Can do.
So, so.
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
Hey.
You're making a big mistake.
Hey buddy.
C'mon!
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
(yelling) DARREN!
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Good for you.
Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
Ok, but I got this...
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
Well, I practically raised his kids.
Yep.
(screaming) Waahhh!!!
Well, he thinks you wear those.
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Yeah, it's, uh, me.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
No no, he's fine.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
I thought paper covered rock?
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin.
Yeah?
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Anything new with that guy on drugs?
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!
Let me tell it ..
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Now what's that?
Kramer.
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
Yeah, yeah. I wonder hmm.
Confront Jerry? I can't.
You want to sit here?
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
No! She needs it now!
I am baking a pie!
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
No! I'm not the Assman.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
(immediately) Yeah.
What beats rock?
I lost my balance.
I'd love to help you move.
No. At your apartment.
Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
All right, you're not fancy!
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
Come on Come on!
(an idea occurs) You don't say.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
No! Never.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
I dig.
I'm hip.
That's your problem, buddy.
Yeah, come in.
You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
Hah?
Consolation Guy is big.
Oh, yes indeed...
He almost beat me.
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.
I thought I DID!
She was probably joking.
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
Oh, hey.
Okay...
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
W...It's four.
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Got to.
(to the intercom) Come on up.
C'mon it's my turn.
(Flattered) Oh?
I came by to get my ball.
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
hey
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Yeah.
You suffer for your soup.
Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?
I knew you would.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
[still lost] I know that guy...
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
Mornin'.
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
Yeah, I turned up the heat.
Of course, yes.
1937, 1937, 1937...
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
Why?
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
Uh, well there was an incident.
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Oh, not a problem.
What's a Chuckle?
(Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.
(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
Happy birthday paruba!
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Alright, lean forward, relax.
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Well, b -- it was stolen.
Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
What?
Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.
No, no, no, I didnt.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Oh boy. Woop...
I'll take it.
Any word from Nana?
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Tony.
Need any help with those?
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
What?
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
Well, now look, just leave me alone.
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
Alright, you got something better?
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Oh bold and beautiful.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
Hey, hey, it's George.
Yeah, yeah.
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
What, is it for a job or something?
Whoa, man!
(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
You looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
There are no delicatessens under Communism.
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Yeah.
Well? Did he call?
I only got hundreds.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.
You're positive it's statute?
Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
I think we've all experienced that.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
This slicer is indomitable.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Nothing Nothing.
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
You stink. (He exits)
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...
All the time?
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
Hey.
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
Well...
Hey
hey
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
Yeah,
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
This truck is dying. We're losing him.
Big! Big!
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
I think we lost him.
Who did?
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Duty.
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
(indicating) The door's on a diagonal.
What?
I never had an air conditioner.
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
We are talking.
Uh, Kramer.
What, again with you?
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
That was a close one.
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Mickey
George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti
Well neither am I.
Hi.
You're wasting your life.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
Toxic gas!!!
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
I think I hit my head again!
Hey.
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Well, this has all been one big tease!
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Jerry
Good, huh?
Well, I'm not an idiot.
Hey.
Put that on the top of your list.
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Well, I don't think they're real.
I'm taking the board with me.
I'm the babysitter
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
Well, you're getting heavy.
What is this, huh?
No.
Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola.
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
So he actually had it?
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
Well, you're not checked at on it.
(leaves, upset) Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--
Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
Yap I know.
Oh mama.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
Okay, how much?
No!
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
What?
Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
You shoulda come, Jerry.
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
What happened there?
Well, are you gonna wear it?
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
Oo yiggity diggigg
Well, where is it?
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
It is very obtrusive.
Yeah.
(quietly) Jerry.
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
Yeah.
Cubed.
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
(To Jerry) Yates.
Brought my phone.
I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
(quietly) L-l (look)
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
All right, what is your deductible?
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
Downtown.
You know I never got a library card.
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
It was there!
Sure do.
Here's your money.
What? When did this happen?
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Name's Kramer.
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.
Oh. Oh, George.
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
Well, youre still here?
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
Whoa, I'm Kramer.
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
Well that's not how she remembers it.
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
Right on the mouth.
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.
No, it's just too much.
Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
Really?
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
Joey
Jerry, you should pay that price.
Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
Oh, you better believe it.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
I know, it's a long story.
Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves)
Hello.
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
Woah, woah, come on.
Would you be interested?
Oh, yeah! Me.
Scared of being shot.
Ma!
What...?
Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
Yeah, but did you tape it?
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
for a little while
You awake?
But Jackie--
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Hey, Dwayny.
Use a belt.
I love you, too, buddy, and George--
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Yeah.
Now, where's that tool shed of yours?
Seattle, yeah!
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
Alright, what did you do to Poppie?
Tantric yoga?
What card?
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Maybe he's with the company.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
You must be kidding.
Hey, Ralph.
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Oh, no.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Oh, boy.
Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Well, move in here.
Well, where the meat goes?
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
The Maestro.
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
How ya feelin'?
Hmm. That's a shame.
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
Jerry what's the matter?
Giddy-up.
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
You didnt want her in the building?
Oh, well, yeah, it's good.
Is this the interference?
Right this way, mister Doody!
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Not at all.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?
Encounter shiatsu.
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Read another poem.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
(to Jerry) Hey, man.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Elaine.
Well, that's out of the question.
What bachelor auction?
Uh, I didn't see him.
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Oh, you don't say.
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
Oh, yeah.
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.
Oh, yes.
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Get out of here.
Oh, hello.
Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
No you can't, Jerry.
it was a big rock
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
Uh, well, uh, we --
Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)
No. That's bush league.
Those kids look pretty disappointed.
Well hello Photo store Sheila.
You mind if I use it in my book?
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
But you haven't seen..
Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Yeah.
(to Frank) I told you.
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Most of them don't even have batteries.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
Thats definitely you.
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
Let me talk to him.
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
oh oh oh oh oh
Do I think? He's repugnant.
How did they ever find you?
Hey, what are you doing here?
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
Jerry, I'll take care of it.
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)
Okay, please! Please tell me!
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
I'll bet I can guess it.
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Yeah?
Mmm
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
I didn't know.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
What about me?
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Hello, there.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.
Darren is going away for a long long time.
I say we get him.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
You wanna go see him?
Ya that was pretty good, huh?
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
Showering. How long does it take you?
Newman! Hes good friends with him.
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
Jerry...
Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.
C'mon.
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Hey, Harold, what do you think?
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
Jerry he's a conductor.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Hi.
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
(shouts) Connie!
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
Oh, yeah.
Take it.
Hey, our meat problems are solved.
Well, please?
Hey.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
Right.
Well, I didn't believe you.
No, I'm the baby-sitter.
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
Well that's a burgeoning continent.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
Hey!
(to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
Yes, It's a fine day
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
I don't care, whatever.
Well, just tell me everything, huh?
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
I never take it.
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
What?
That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
That kid is gonna be all right.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
No.
Wish?! Newman!
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
Are you all right?
Yei-
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
Completely naked.
Mary Kay uh?
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
No. It says 'main line'.
Are those shoes comfortable?
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
I dont understand.
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
I told you he could do it.
Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
It's Keith.
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
Assman.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
It's definitely preposterous.
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
"So you got any cavities?"
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
Uh, no.
Yeah.
Well, it's uh, common courtesy.
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Yeah, yeah, chew on that.
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Forty-eight.
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
Oh, yeah, that's...
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Hey.
(answering) PBS pledge drive.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Tell me about it!
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
Yeah, well, no good?
Steve Gendason.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
It's a sweater.
Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
What's Festivus?
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
Uh, hey buddy.
Really?
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
Well, I'm still shopping it around.
So, so what do you want me to do?
Yeah, well nothing before noon.
Tell me about it.
Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
The discount pharmacy?
What?
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
You got anything to drink? Agua?
So , you blew it?
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
Goohhhhck.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
Too much?!
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
"Go Jimmy"
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
Yeah. That's them.
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
Do you have any action at all?
Hey.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
What's that perfume?
Hey.
He's sleeping with his maid!
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
Well that's weird
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Oh, come on!
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Go ahead, drink it, George.
Hey, are you performing tomorrow?
Drive the horse?
Yea.
It would put me at ease.
What did I just say?
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
Alright, we'll take the subway.
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
Look, you gotta do me a favor.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
(Thinks) 1500 dollars.
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Ya
Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.
AAH! AAGH!
Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.
Hi.
Oh, thank you.
Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
No.
Huh?
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
What did you do?
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
(looking down, nodding) Hi.
Uh-huh. Its good?
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
I do?
What is it blowing up?
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
$15.90.?
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
Yeah calzone.
Hey, Clyde!
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Well, it's not really gold.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
Who's to say it didn't?
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
Oh hey!
Who's Gennice?
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
Bania?
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
Ive got the Kavorka Jerry.
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Ah, Tony, he's good.
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
What's up?
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
We'll take it!
(waving wing) Hey buddy.
Liked me.
Feel this.
He doesn't like you.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
Well, that's only uh, 58 years.
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
(shivering) Hypothermia.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
I wanna be a pirate.
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
Do you ever yearn?
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
Yeah, 5.
This is the best way to go!
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
What?
So she's coming?
Alright, alright...
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Hey. New jacket?
Serenity! (He exits)
Hey I know how to sign.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
Jerry.... hey Jeannie.
So, what's your talent?
what about the driver?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Yeow!
I'll be down in a minute.
The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...
You got a blender.
Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
(knocks on desk) Is thi oak?
I liked Marlene. Whats her number?
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Hey.
Oh, he's a tomcat.
I was going to dump this.
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
What? What are you talking about?
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
There you go.
Right here. (Elaine enters)
Well, I didnt think ahead.
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
Hey.
Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.
It's Phil's.
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
Hey, Frank.
Why, what's wrong with bro?
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
So!
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Oh, I love curls.
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
(mumbles) b'd b'd
How you doing?
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
Damn!
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
No sweat.
Hey. It's really wet out there.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
Oh, giddyup. Yeah.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
Yeah ... backstage.
[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.
Yeah, there's something in the air.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.
Yeah.
(quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
What's going on?
No, a thousand!
I don't know.
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
Whoa, back up a second.
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
What's the matter with you?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
Definitely.
"Hey!"
Jerry?
What happened to the car?
(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
That's right
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Hey! Hi Elaine!
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
Yup, yup!
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
Woah, woah, that's mine.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
I see.
You got any Ipecac?
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
Yeah!
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
Well I suppose they are wasted.
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Yeye cat fight!
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Uh.. that's right.
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?
Well, what have you been doing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, I'm going in.
Well, they're in...
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
Well?
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Ah.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Look look.
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
So, okay uh whats the problem?
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
"Ah! what.. Tim Whatley?
Oh yeah!!
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
You could've introduced me.
Hey, buddy.
Uh huh. Your back hurt?
Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
You've been warned.
"All right euhhm....."
No
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
I'm at the airport.
Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.
Pzzzt. No.
The Netherlands?
No, no, I would turn you in.
Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
Jerry!
(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back--
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Oh, you liked it huh.
(Ow!) It's my stomach.
h-Yeah...
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
O.K.!
Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
HUAAHHH!!
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat.
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro.
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
And laughter is the best medicine.
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
I want one of those!
Yeah, so?
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
I didn't realize it was a full box.
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
Hey.
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Yeah, yeah. I think he will.
Let me see.
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
HELLO!
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
Hey buddy.
Yeah.
Wow.
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
HeYAWaaa
No, man! Not the gas!
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
(from inside) Yeah?
Hey!
Well, that is strange.
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
No. It's Original Ray's.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
I like to strain the sauce.
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Goodnight, Mr Oh.
[In Newman's ear] I don't like it...
(mumbling with full mouth) No, Im good.
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
Did you ask her about me?
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
Lomez, Im Leavin
(from inside) Security issue!
I don't know.
Yeah. So long, Morty.
Yeah, so whats the problem?
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
Well, why?
I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
Three under par.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
It's Pam.
Lets see what Jerry has to eat.
We're gonna be right there.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
I'm sure it'll come out.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!
Double bugger!
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Well, I tell time by the sun.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
Movie?
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
We'll order Chinese.
Let me see you do it.
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
Hey.
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
You just blew my mind.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
A gymnast!
Fungi.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
OK. Let's turn the water on now.
Giddyup.
Hi...........What's that?
...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
Lit _ tle Jer _ ry!
What's that guy's last name again?
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Where's a phone?
That's all I got.
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
A hole in one eh.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
(entering) Hey.
Alright come on.
Ooh, it's a big one!
George! George!
Oooh, lobsters.
Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)
Wet and wild.
Don't...
"What!"
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
(trying to get away) woah
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Why, what...?
huh.. my batteries are dead
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
Sure, do you need a glove?
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
Bald?
You said take 'em.
Ok, I'll go with you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
It was supposed to erupt.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
Well, it's a valuable appendage.
You're right he's ripping me off
I love her, Jerry!
You don't know what you're missing buddy.
"What kind?"
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
Okay, Joey.
Yeah.
No. No
12,000 BTU's.
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Uh, no.
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
They're all looking up.
Sure.
Well, Im taking this back.
(theatrical) I made a mistake.
Hello, boys and girls.
Oh, I really think you're wrong.
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
(frustrated) Wha??
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
Uh, yes. Yeah.
No, lets go to the couch...
Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
(Between coughs) Hey.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
Thanks man.
Uh, uh.
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
What are they gonna do?
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Where's the lights. Whoa!
...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
Oh, that's a prickly one.
All right.
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
So, Im Filk?
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Got the paper?
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
Jerry, I need another massage!
Oowe (Kramer noise -- hes eating something)
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
Not necessarily.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
Oh yeah! It's you!
Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.
You gotta go.
Yeah, I kissed her.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
(handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.
Damn!
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
No, no, no. There was no money.
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
His tooth marks. He bit me.
Why can't I play Kramer?
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
We ran outta space.
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.
Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
Yallo. What delay industries?
Egh. These aren't candies.
Why don't you take a handicap spot...
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
Jerry, that's in Sweden.
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
Shes a sweet kid.
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!
You mean you've never tasted lobster?
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Look, just meet with him. ?????.
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
What do you think, Stan?
What do you mean?...
(yells) Elaine!
You can't get it from that.
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Ah-huh.
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
George, I'm in love with her!
I've had it with 'em.
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
Hey, Morty.
Hal, .. uh Langerhans.
Did you hear about Martin?
Yeah.
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
Yay!
Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
(low tone)Yeahhehehehe
Hey buddy. Remember me?
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
(shocked) How can you not have insurance?
Good one? It's the Commando 8.
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Now that's impossible.
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
They wont take a cage full of birds.
You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
NEWMAN ! Stop it!!
He's lying.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
Let's go.
Thanks. Have a good day.
I have to?
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
He looks happy to me.
Well, there is something you can do.
Let's go!
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
I don't have anything. Ask him.
Oh, and that voice!
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
Her birds are dead.
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
So how we doin' on time?
Its all supervised.
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
(looking at watch) Ssssh--ah! They just closed!
I'm dizzy.
Hey, Frank!
Well, I think one of us should leave.
No, no! My car's not running.
Oh yeah!
(shouts to the telephone) Hi George!
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
But wasn't that taken off the market?
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
(suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
Ah, well, it's a business transaction.
Wellll, isn't it obvious?
Well, I got gonorrhea.
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
Is there a tree?
Yeah.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
Well I ...
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Whoa!
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
No, it isn't!
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
You got ripped buddy.
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
Look I want thirty-five percent.
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby)
Stefanie. 2-G.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
I don't like it.
Ya?
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
Oh, mama...
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
I expect you both to be there.
Yeah. He's intense, man.
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
Never said anything about the banking.
It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.
Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!
Well, um, goodnight.
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!
Because it's no good.
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
Do you?
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
I'm very, very sorry.
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!
You're a chucker.
(interested) Uh-huh.
Yeah
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
(sort of falling backwords) Yowm!
No, no. Your not playing the game.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
Oh yes
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
Uh? Voila.
Sure do!
Naw, that's not my style.
That's a lotta yearning, huh?
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Yeah, alright...
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
Its good to have you back, Stan.
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
What's today?
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
I thought you took the test.
Yaya
Ah, no, that's not in the budget.
(CALLING OUT) Jerry!
Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
who?
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
I get to play Kramer.
Whoop! Whoop!
Uh? Oh that must be it.
I thought it was a closet.
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Oh, tell me about it.
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
Cause they look comfortable.
Yeah, those are New York plates.
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
I thought she was pregnant.
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
Yeah.
No...
So go. GEORGE Here?
You didn't hear?
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
wow
(Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined.
Why?!
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
How serendipitous.
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
Cat fight?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
Rusty!
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
Stay strong buddy.
Funny.
How do you know?
Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Newman died?
Giddyup.
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
What the heck is going on here?
Who says I want a noodle?
I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
No.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
So she works at the zoo?
Why don't ya' leave?
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
No, Sir. We are down there.
"Hey! What's this?"
Have a good one.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Me and Lola....
Look away, I'm hideous.
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
hey George, hear that?
Gladly.
Mary Hart!
Come on. What'd he say?
"Hey Jimmy"
Yeah!
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Yah-hey.
Yes, because they've already deducted it.
Bulimic,
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
Yeah, that's weird.
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.
Buenos dias.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
You're in a weird mood.
Yeah!
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
Well!
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
Yeah.
Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
I know.
Yeah.
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
That's caged heat.
Uh huh.
Quo? Thats not a word.
[In Newman's ear] Make us.
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
He overcooked it. It's ruined.
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
Just give me another chance!
Well, ah you were right.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
I love her!
So, what's George doing?
Jerry, if the man is in pain...
Here's your scrubber back.
Hey.
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
yeaaaaah!
Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!
Ooo!
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
No.
Aw, c'mon.
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
How much are you down altogether?
Well, Babe Ruth did it.
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
So whats going on between you and Gina?
Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
That's true. That's right.
oh, what's that from?
Uh huh.
Ooo Paella
Yeah!
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Hoochie moochie. (haha)
Now this I like.
(Laughing) What is that, a new bit?
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
Oughh!
Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
Wonder what's goin' on.
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
"What!!!"
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
So Heather called?
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
Watch out!
Hey, where ya going?
Como se dice.. waterbed?
Ya.
Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
Yeah, I'm going to poke around...
What?!
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
Hey.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
Hey, what are you gonna see?
Hey.
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
George, they closed up.
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
Not bloody likely..
Yeah.
(smiles) yeah.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
No, I want you to see me naked.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Danke schoen, my little dumplings.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
A dotchie cotchie dochie,
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
(CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.
I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.
P B and J's. What d'you think?
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
Who's that?
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Good question.
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
No, no. No doctors.
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
Well, he was a little standoffish.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Yup! Yup!
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
That was the wrong card.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
Na, I am down
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
This was set for 2 minutes. See?
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
I'm loving this.
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
You know, I faked it.
(yells) Newmanniun!!
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
(waddling after Joey) Joey! Joey!
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
Excellent question.
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
For what?
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
???
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
It's Grossbard!
Yeaaahmm....
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Heey.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
Oh! Big surprise ( he leaves frustrated)
What is that, hickory?
Well my stomach was burning.
Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
You're on, cowboy!
I don't know..
Can I sleep with you?
No, it's statue.
A big fat turkey.
Thats you.
Hey!
Is, uh, David Puddy there?
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.
You can smell me without the drink.
What do ya mean?
Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
That's what I wanna know.
Heey!
(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
I...I...
(Laughing) She caught you?
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
Well I have the same shirt.
They gave them all to Goodwill.
Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
Well, wow.
Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
(realisation) Mother's Day.
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
What happened to the doll?
Brody's in.
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
Maybe.
Yeah! Ha ha.
hey, you're hungry? Monk's?
Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!
Hey, Seinfelds!
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
These are my friends Jerry and Elaine.
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
How about a bathroom?
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
When does it start?
Oh yeah, I?m selling.
Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
Does that bother you?
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
Feel it.
Talk to me.
[In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
Yaow.
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.

Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.

Why?
Yeah, I love going to the country.
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
Maybe she's bulimic
Well what are we ...dog meat.

Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.

No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
What you doing?!
What? It's a beautiful day.
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
It's good suspension!
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
There was an incident.
Yea.
Yes. It's dangerous.
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
A billiard room.
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Hey, buddy, don't say no!
Well I didn't hear any Plus.
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
Yeah. Newman jumped.
Shh, shh.
Oh, great ride.
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
Did you tell him the Packyderm story?
You killed.
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
I like what you've done with that.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.
Heyahhh!
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
What's Filk?
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
Well, I havent changed my mind.
Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Oh I accept.
Morty, are you coming in?
What?
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.
Look, she didn't mean anything.
