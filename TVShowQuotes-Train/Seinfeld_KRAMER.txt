Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)
(Struggling) Hey!
Well neither am I.
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
What whip?
"yeah, yeah, lets do that."
I love her, Jerry!
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
That's a nipple.
Goohhhhck.
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
That kid...
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Uh huh.
Oh, no you don't.
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
Did you offer those guys a drink?
Jerry, I need another massage!
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
I'm in love.
She was probably joking.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Did you see that guy?
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
Uh, no.
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
(screaming) Waahhh!!!
OH! I got to call her back.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.
(quietly) Jerry.
I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead.
Oh mama.
Oh, hey!
You've got a message buddy.
You have to know everything, don't you?
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
Oh yeah, you talked to her.
I want one of those!
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
What's Filk?
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
Well they gotta be soft.
Definitely.
(to Mickey) You know? She's right.
"HEY I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!!!"
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
Just gonna find out if he's interested.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
What...?
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
You don't think so.
Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
What's the problem?
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
Raquel Welch!
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
Tupperware.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
No, it's just too much.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Oh yeah, she's fantastic....
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
They moved in together?
What, did you ask her?
Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
Naomi, come on let's get goin'.
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Did you ask her about me?
"No,No...You were here first."
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Come on up. It's Brody.
Oh, that's right.
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
Uh huh, right.
I wanna see it.
(whistles) What's he like huh?
Yeah.
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Are you sure?
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
Huh? Yeah.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
Well, I havent changed my mind.
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
No time!
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
My mom Babs.
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Oh.
No. No
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
"What? You're crazy."
Yeah.
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
You stink. (He exits)
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
[In Newman's ear] I don't like it...
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
(knocks on desk) Is thi oak?
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
Ah, Tony, he's good.
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
Did you hear about Newman?
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
We are talking.
She said she'll do it.
Nothin'
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
Youre a human being.
(Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
What would be the point in taking the water?
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
What?
Well, I'm not giving it back.
Yeah. me neither.
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
"Yes sweep."
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
Whoa!!!....That was you?
Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
Oh, boy.
Why would you think I would invite him?
You're right he's ripping me off
I don't even really work here!
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
Hey! Hi Elaine!
Newman!
Alright, I'm gonna see you later.
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
How many miles?
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
Im human.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
Wish?! Newman!
The coffee was too hot.
Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
hey
So you gonna use it?
Yeah.
The bank can pay 'em.
What is that, hickory?
What, did they kick you out too?
Did you hear about Martin?
Not really.
Hey
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Not THAT hot.
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
[still lost] I know that guy...
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable.
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
Umas number is on that ticket.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
No.
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
No way I'm taking fifteen.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
Hey, hey, it's George.
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
Does that bother you?
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
Como se dice.. waterbed?
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
All right, let's go.
Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
well it just doesn't sit well.
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Jerry!
(indicating) The door's on a diagonal.
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
Yeah, she dumped me!
The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
Well, I didnt think ahead.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
(mocking) Too bad you got engaged.
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
What?
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
You're moving to California?
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
Damn!
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
Yes. It's dangerous.
Hey.
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
Oo yiggity diggigg
Just drive.
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
Hey, watch where you're kicking!
Here's your scrubber back.
Sure do!
You know I never got a library card.
Sure!
We're making sausages.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
Brown?
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
I'm doin' fine.
Awe, alright
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
"Lets share.. we share....Awight"
"Eh!! Cosmo Kramer. Nice to meet you"
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
When we went to dinner the other night.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
Youre not going to wear this.
I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
(Between coughs) Hey.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
What ever turns you on.
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
Well, now I can't see Jerry.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
Why not?
Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
Oh. (Waiter approaches table)
No. It says 'main line'.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
It's cucumbers.
Yeah.
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
Yeah, put these glasses on.
Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.
(to Jerry) Hey buddy.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
The Netherlands?
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
Flea bites?
Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Yeah.
Oh, that's my phone.
George?
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
You'd think...
Yeah that's right.
uuh-
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
I found it on the road.
About the opera.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
Wha--
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
Who?
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
Come on Come on!
There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
Yayaya...
Yeah, he was fired.
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
What do you mean?
On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna.
Hey, what's going on?
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Hey, George what are you doing here?
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
Why not?
Conceivably.
Hey! George.....Lily..
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
Huh?
Uh? Voila.
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
Alright, you got something better?
Well, move in here.
Yeah, that's weird.
I put them on a dental chair.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
What's the matter? You've got a cold?
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
You get to make your own pie!
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Thats definitely you.
No, it's statue.
Yeah!
Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.
And?
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
I'm very happy with this.
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
Come on ,Just take a taste
Uh huh.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
Because it's no good.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
It's very refreshing!
And go we will.
What, you're giving him this suit?
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
I don't know...
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
Have a good one.
Well, you're not checked at on it.
I am Kramer.
But Jackie--
Uh, well, there's someone else.
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
Never said anything about the banking.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Hey.
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
I know.
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
Well, um, goodnight.
(trying to get away) woah
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Oh?
C'mon it's my turn.
Oh, that's too bad.
Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.
Well, how did this happen?
I need to talk to you.
Yeah
Why?
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
C'mon Jerry!
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
Well, I gotta do somethin'.
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
Good question.
Hey.
Well, you can't leave now.
Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Is that a problem?
Oowe (Kramer noise -- hes eating something)
Because of the coffee thing?
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
Yeah. Sure. Sure.
Right by her!
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, God.
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
Is, uh, David Puddy there?
What happened?
(pointing) You can go over here.
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
It was under a spoon!
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
Oh, these are nice corners, huh?
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Hey.
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
Where do I know that guy from?
Giddy-up.
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
Yeah.
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Ooooh... You stink.
(Thinks) No, I don't think so.
Would you stop it.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
Oh, it's a birthday card.
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
I'm sure it'll come out.
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.
All right, all right.
We'll take it!
Well no, I don't have them on me.
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
(smiles) yeah.
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
I may have to drive that place out of business.
Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
(quietly) yeah.
What are YOU doing here?
I get to play Kramer.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
Over three hundred?
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
Huh? Who are you?
Uh, uh.
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
yeah yeah, (in a flinty voice) flinty
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
Yeah (quietly)
No no look, I was baby-sitting
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
Three under par.
Hey what again?
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
What are you talking about?
Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
Newman?
My god, you're rich.
Hey, everything my man.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
"I'm a guest of honor."
Don't...
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
No. It's Original Ray's.
Because Im a pod?
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
How ya feelin'?
That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
I live for Merlot.
Why?
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
Hey.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
I'll go.
There, there's your hives.
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
So what?
I'm good for it.
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
Yes!
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
(a bit startled) Ahh.
Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.
"So you got any cavities?"
How much?
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby)
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
Poise. Poise!
George, I'm in love with her!
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Ah, no, that's not in the budget.
And you'll get it back.
My friend he's a conductor.
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
What about him?
(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.
He begged me.
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
You mean you've never tasted lobster?
Look out below!!
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
Alright come on.
Tantric yoga?
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
(pointing at Farkus) Very funny.
Wait, wait, wait...
Gimme your credit card.
"They're Plyometric.(sp?)"
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
Well, please?
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
Huh?
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
You know, I faked it.
Wheehh
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
Hey, what's he doin'?
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
So, Im Filk?
Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?
Right here. (Elaine enters)
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
What?
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
Yeah, I kissed her.
Good, huh?
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?
Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
What's in the deep end?
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?
Okay, who wants meatloaf?
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Well, that's out of the question.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
Me neither.
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
I don't know where the tops are.
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh my!
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
What's that perfume?
(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
Getting some cereal
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
What?
Are you still on the pill?
Hey.
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
(mumbles and leaves)
Oh, boy.
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
Well, that's classified.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
Alright, how often do we do it?
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
What stuff?
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
Jer.
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Huh?
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
Yeah ... backstage.
Well, why no T-bone?!
hey
alright, who's gonna tell her
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
Mary Kay uh?
You can't get a stool in here.
Is there a tree?
No, I swear.
George. I thought you were gonna Change.
Uh, habla ingles?
You said take 'em.
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
Her birds are dead.
Rusty!
All right, I'll see you later.
Showering. How long does it take you?
Oh, he's the best...and the worst.
what about the driver?
(shouts to the telephone) Hi George!
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Ive gotta feed the birds.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
Yeah..
[thinks for a while]
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Hey. These are for you Olive.
Lyndon Johnson.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
Well I have the same shirt.
ho ho ho ho.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
Well, you're not reading it now.
What?
Ch- oo-... what?
Yeah.
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
Forty-eight.
Hey.
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
He's very generous, isn't he?
He's quite a character, isn't he?
...Okay, yes, shoot.
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
(opening a card) Oh, a check.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
For what?
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
Shut up! I'll get my coat!
Hi,
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
Wait, wait, (Exits)
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
Yeah, morning.
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
Hey, Elaine scratch my back.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
Do you have a woman?
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?
But why?
They're ladies' glasses.
Yeah, 5.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
Hey.
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
Heeeeey...
What did I just say?
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
No, I got dibs!
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
No, it isn't!
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
And to the bathroom.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
Where are you going?
A dry-cleaning bill for what?
What beats rock?
What puddle?
No. And now I can't get it back.
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
What happened here?
She didn't have any?
Huh?
Yes
A hand model?
Yeah, hi Elaine.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.
I'm loving this.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who could love me?
Well, I'd say it nicely.
Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Who's to say it didn't?
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
It was in my laundry.
Oh yeah, yeah.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
All right, c'mon, let's go again.
Yeah.
Yeah, that def jam is a force.
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.

Oh, so he took you back.

No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
What point?
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
Hi.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
(frustrated) Wha??
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
Oh! Big surprise ( he leaves frustrated)
(Laughing) She caught you?
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Oh, hey.
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
"My wife has an inner ear infection."
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
Oh, well I have many associates.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
Hey, buddy, don't say no!
Whoa, man!
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
Ooooh I like Ring Dings.
What's today?
You gotta come through with the hips first.
Right.
Well, I don't know what to do.
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
Oh, my God...
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
What? When did this happen?
"You want me to sleep with you?"
What do you mean?
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
Hey.
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
Sure Mrs. Anvino, ya.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
I can't work with these!
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
Uh, yeah.
This mango is delicious!
Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
Now this I like.
September third.
Hot and spicy.
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Seattle, yeah!
(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.
Assman.
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
Rock.
Well, why not?
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)
Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
Alright, alright...
Oh, gees...
(puzzled) Phone call?
I dont want the levels!
Naw ,na , that's no good.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
What?
No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
Alright, c'mon!
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
He's my caddy.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Yap I know.
Hey
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
My name's Kramer.
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.
Woah.
Alright, where you going?
(off camera) Are we getting this?
let go, hey grab the rock
Well, it's common sense.
Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
(acting standoffish) Hello.
Oh, you don't remember me.
(from inside) OK!
How 'bout if I put a few things --
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
You got it?
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
(putting on the lotion) Ya
What?
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
I'll pick her up.
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
"So, you're heading home?"
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
Well, this has all been one big tease!
This hallway smells like potatoes.
Well, that's weird.
Yeah, sit, sit, sit Weeell! (laughing, clapping)
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
I get that too. (exits)
oh... (goes to the bedroom)
(Definite) Cigars.
Y'know, art's a great investment.
What's that red dot on your sweater?
Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.
I think we've all experienced that.
No.
(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.
I've had it with 'em.
Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
There were 1,650 survivors.
Woah, that's quite a honk!
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
I'm taking the board with me.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
Yeah (again quietly)
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
(backing off) OK.
Thats okay. He doesnt care.
(not convincing) Uh, yeah.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
hey
Call him and tell him
Where?
Hey.
Hi...........What's that?
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
Oh. Cotton Dockers!
(off screen) Outta My Way!
Some nut in a clown suit!
(looking at watch) Ssssh--ah! They just closed!
Yep. (Mumbles off)
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
got problems Jerry.
Come on JUST TASTE!!!
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
Not at all.
What's that guy's last name again?
No, man! Not the gas!
Dark blue.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
Oh, come on, they don't drive!
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
All right, everybody! I'm back!
Oh...yeah!
YAOH!
Whoa, whoa!!
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
Ah!
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
(points) Digidi.
I thought we were talking about me.
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
Well my stomach was burning.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
Don't be a fool.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
That's good thinking.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
I told ya.
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
What about Sundays and holidays?
Yaow.
Big! Big!
(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.
Yeaaahmm....
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Downtown.
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
[OC] THE BEACH!!!
(matter of fact) He had breasts.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
The discount pharmacy?
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
You're positive it's statute?
Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
Huckleberry.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
A gymnast!
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
Levels.
Hi.
I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
Where you going?
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
How much are you down altogether?
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
make me an offer.
Yeah, yeah, I know him.
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
Well, more bad news Jerry.
Now what is Executive?
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
Hey, buddy!
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
(Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
Let me talk to him.
Sure you have.
Where?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
I'll do it.
Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]
Anything...
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
(mumbles) b'd b'd
I don't believe that.
Hello.
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
Hey.
Hello boys.
Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?
He's sleeping with his maid!
Did you tell him the Packyderm story?
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
Well, Happy Festivus.
"So what's wrong with that?
No.
No problem there.
I've got plenty of ideas.
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
(immediately) Yeah.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
Y'aah!
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
Funny.
No, Sir. We are down there.
Where can I put this?
What?
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
Hey, Georgie.
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
Yeah, a different one.
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
You're a chucker.
She quit.
Oh yeah, coming up...
You better get the door.
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Yeah, how was it?
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
(waddling after Joey) Joey! Joey!
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
She's got a kid?
Ah No no, I haven't.
Well, I overbought!
(to the intercom) Come on up.
Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
I can't ...
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
... My mother's a matron!
Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
Thanks, buddy.
Whats to think about?
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
(Making a point) Not everyday.
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
Where's Jerry?
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
Oh, boy.
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
You want to sit here?
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
Mmm, these are good, huh?
Well, I sold them to Bania.
Hey.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Hi, little buddy.
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
I drank too much water in the shower.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Yeah! Ha ha.
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
Potato man!
[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
Well I suppose they are wasted.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
Jerry, you forgot your purse.
Sure you do.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
All right, What about the money?
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
Newman! Newman!!
How's that feel?
Yeah, I'll be okay.
for a little while
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
I think he looks fantastic.
Yup, yup!
Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
Phew.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
Mmm.
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
It's over!
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
Then I'll be back.
Hey!
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
Nobody put a gun to your head.
I don't believe this.
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Hey, Dwayny.
Yes!
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Is Elaine going?
You're just out for sex!!
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Ah, well, it's a business transaction.
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
Want some mango?
You got a blender.
Uh, yeah.
What's that?
Encounter shiatsu.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
hey
Just get some gum or something.
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
No.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
(handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Nothin'
Giddyup.
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
It's definitely preposterous.
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
Brody's in.
Hey.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
I got a line in the movie!
Alright, what did you do to Poppie?
You got that right!
I thought we were friends...
What, she's been away?
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
What the heck is going on here?
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
Equivalency.
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
I'm in. Let's go for it.
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
It was about 1200 bucks.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Let me see.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Uh, you remember my coffee table book?
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Look, you gotta do me a favor.
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
Yes!
I'm off hot water.
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Are too.
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
Fungus.
Here's your money.
Maybe he's with the company.
Yippie-yi-yay!
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Shell-shocked?
You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
Maybe that's what he's got.
Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.
Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
(to Gary) How you doing?
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
These street toughs, they robbed me.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
YAH! No Buts
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
What are they gonna do?
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
Yeah, ok.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Oh, boy.
All right....Sit down George.
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
Oh, we have to do this now.
Yeah, I've seen them do that.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
Yeah... I do great, yeah.
Yeah. That's strange.
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
We're straightening out!
To the whole scene. (sniff)
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
Can't hear a thing.
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Yeah, well nothing before noon.
Well, can you call him an ambulance?
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
No.
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
Hey there.
Oh, come on.
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
Yeah!
I want to talk to Calvin.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
What kind of a person are you?
Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
So how much are we gonna make?
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
So, is everything cool? or what?
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Big mistake.
Look I want thirty-five percent.
Getting something to eat.
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
He's ripping me off
(to George) Yeah!
Uh huh.
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
Jerry?
I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
What?
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
He's a happy camper huh?
I thought it was a closet.
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
Why were you holding the door open for?
Can you do that for me, buddy?
George, we're sorry.
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
Uh, I didn't see him.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
Well what are we ...dog meat.
Does George know?
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
Hey!
There you go monkey boy.
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
What's up?
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
What are the chances of that?
Jerry, you should pay that price.
No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
When do you pit the sauce on?
I...I...
Got the paper?
I'm Cosmo.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
I won't!
No, I want to show you.
Do you have any action at all?
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Yeah, yeah. I wonder hmm.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Any mustard? This is empty.
He wants to talk.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
That's right.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
Yeesh-jip!
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Jerry? Jerry!
It's just a write off for them.
Yeah, those are New York plates.
(being grabbed by the security officials) Hey!
Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?
Oh, he's a dunker.
Yeah.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
My stuffed cabbage!
How about a bathroom?
What state?
Aaaaahhh...!!!
It is very obtrusive.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
Ya that was pretty good, huh?
What, you took a cab?
What?
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
C'mon Seattle, let's go.
What? It's a beautiful day.
well hello Jane
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
hello
I'd love to help you move.
Okay.
On the signal, George. On the signal.
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Shes a sweet kid.
Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
Newman, wait!
(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
All right, I'll take Karen.
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
They wont take a cage full of birds.
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
(opening the fridge) Sayonara.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
C'mon!
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
These are great seats huh?
Aaaaah.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
"There's no candy around here. hey! Jimmy."
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
What do you think, Stan?
It's terrible!
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
Hey! Elaine..
Oh.
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Kramerica is no more.
We ran outta space.
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
Oh, you liked it huh.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
Yeah....
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
Hello, there.
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
Rusty! Rusty!
Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Uh, yeah, ah ...
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
Can you give him a cookie?
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
Uh huh
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
(takes a breath)
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.
Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
I'm the babysitter
Well...
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
I am baking a pie!
(enters apartment) Hey.
Yeah.
Maybe I will.
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
(to baby) Koochie koochie koochie koo
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
She made an offer. I took it.
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
Unbelievable.
I think so too.
Hey.
No!
So, so.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
What?
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
Hal, .. uh Langerhans.
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
Yeah...
What's a Chuckle?
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
Hey.
You wanna go get him?
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Hey.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Is that seat taken?
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
Oh here we go--
Will you tape it?
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Right on the mouth.
(positive) That makes me the premiere.
Right!
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
...And you're the manager of the circus.
Y-Yeah, all right.
Me too.
I'm very, very sorry.
Hey, Harold, what do you think?
Ouch!!..........Now!!
Well there ought to be ball men.
Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
Well, youre still here?
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Ok!
Mine, too. I got one more day.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
Oh, we go back a ways.
There you go.
Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
Yeah..
Right.
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
Hey.
-ca.
(looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
Hey. New jacket?
No, I got the tape right here.
Yes, Sansei.
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
I'm shaving with it.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Ah.
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
Oh, hey.
Yeah
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Yeah!
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Not bloody likely..
(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
"Boy , you're looking sharp there Tim."
Okay, Joey.
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
I got time.
Oh, I'm jiff.
(Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Yeah.
So he actually had it?
L'Occupado.
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
Oh.
Ohh!
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
George says "Cut it."
"Yeah!!!"
Yeah!
Hey, what are you gonna see?
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
I think she liked me.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
Can I get in on that?
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
Eh!
Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Let me see you do it.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
Where's a phone?
I can't I can't
Well, maybe I did overextend myself.
Oh, hey, how you doing?
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Yeah.
You got butchered.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
Two and a half points.
Yeah, yeah..
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Hey.
You cooked?
It's your first time. He'll understand.
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
Well, not here.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
He looks happy to me.
I want my vacuum cleaner!
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
Fungi.
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
(lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.
Brought my phone.
"BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING."
(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.
ah! Here we go.
Just give me another chance!
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
Ooh! Remember Poppie?
[Yeah] (through the door)
What about me?
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!
Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry.
I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
You must be kidding.
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
Newman!
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
No, no, no. There was no money.
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?
Hey, what's going on?
Come on, Larry. You know me.
He's spaced out.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
Uh.. that's right.
It was there!
Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
I'm hip.
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
Oh boy. Woop...
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Do I smell?
Uh, Pantene.
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Me?
Good one? It's the Commando 8.
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
Well it's 555-3455.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
Hey, hey.
Ah, I'm glad you're here.
Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.
Ooh! !Dios mio!
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
But wasn't that taken off the market?
(doing the voice) La la la.
So, what's your talent?
You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
Hello.
But this'll get you around?
We'll see you later...
Well, are you gonna wear it?
No job. No women.
OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.
Yeah. (He exits)
Joey
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
So now, what's this got?
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
No, I want you to see me naked.
Jerry . . .
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Watch it good.
Let me tell it ..
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
How could you?
I got it at Joes.
Morty, are you coming in?
What?
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
Right.
It's me!
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
Frank!
Really.
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
What'd you get for it?
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
I went back with Ellen.
What about her?
That's your problem, buddy.
(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Youre not going?
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
...I didn't say that, no.
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
Well you can go to your room and read.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)
All right.
And?
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
You killed them, didn't you?
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
What?
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Yeah well we go way back.
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Oh. What about?
What happened?
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
So, okay uh whats the problem?
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Yeah.
Two is better than one.
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Uh, Varnsen.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Hey, Ralph.
Five minutes. What?
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
Well come on George, finish the story.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Yeah.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
why can't you make a higher roof.
Well, I like yours.
What's that?
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
I'm puttin it on
Bro!
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Definitely.
No.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Bro.
But she wants the shoes.
I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
Well it's muffin stumps
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
Jerry what's the matter?
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
How did this happen?
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.
(shivering) Hypothermia.
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
Why? What happened?
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
I'll break.
Why? What wa?
Wow.
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Yea, yea.
Yeah, sure. Please.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
Ja ja ja - just tell it
I've always wanted to see this.
Double bugger!
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry.
Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.
(low tone) All right.
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
$15.90.?
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
(shaking hands) Yeah.
'bout what?
But where does the meat go?
Ya I told you.
A dotchie cotchie dochie,
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Yeah. All right one chart coming up.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
Can do.
Alright I'll get a blender.
Come on. Are you sure?
Ya?
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Hey!
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
He doesn't like you.
I don't know.
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
O'Brien? Well that's weird.
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...
"All right euhhm....."
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
You got any pliers?
Stop right there.
No. No, he can't do that.
Feel this.
Well I ...
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
Confront Jerry? I can't.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Hello!
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
Ow
Oh, hey, hi buddy.
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
What, are you locking the door now?
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
(intrigued) Really?
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
They're right out here.
Woah, Nelson!
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
C'mon.
Hey.
(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh, giddyup. Yeah.
Well, I'm not an idiot.
Whoop! Whoop!
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?
(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
So how's George?
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Right.... Don't mention my name
Yaya
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
Yeah.
(chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
hey, you're hungry? Monk's?
Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
You got that straight.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
I'm at the airport.
Well, it's not really gold.
Y'hello.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
Seventy -five bucks a month!
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Well, b -- it was stolen.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
What was the question?
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
What do you mean?
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
Ahh....
There you are.
From pain, will come pleasure.
Completely naked.
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
Uh, Dwayne.
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
oh that wouldn't be very good
MUST be banker.
Hey.
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
he asked me
Oh, they were Chemical.
"Oh yes, yes indeed."
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
What's this?
You shut up!
Hmm-mmm.
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
Yeah, yeah, chew on that.
Well that's a burgeoning continent.
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
You got cigars, huh.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
I'll bring back the pot.
Hey, well, this is Sally.
Don't really remember.
Well, I'm still shopping it around.
What? Jimmy Sherman?
Who says I want a noodle?
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
Yeah!
You got it, buddy.
Yeah.
No. No It's Lily
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
Cause Im getting rid of it.
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
I've made an important life decision.
What about a big sponge?
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
Oh I'll take these.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
If only I could say things like that around her.
Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?
All right, who's down there?
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
Yeah, so?
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
Uh, Cosmo Kramer?
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
Maybe.
No.
Help me!! Help me!
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
All right George, come on, take a look.
Well, why not.
I know.
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
Well, yeah.
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
Hey.
So she works at the zoo?
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
I'll just squeeze in...
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
Wha?
So how we doin' on time?
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Well that's not how she remembers it.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
Now what's with you?
You are a lover boy!!
Uh, Kramer.
Clear blue sky!
Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Oh, I'm with him.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
hell-oo
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
Yeah.
Hey...
Our rickshaw?
Are you all right?
Yep yep yep.
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
"HEY TAXI!!!.....TAXI!!"
What?!
Habla espanol?
Yea.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
Oh, thank you.
Hey!
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Oh yeah she's a beauty.
Yeah.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.
Are you sure you're not pregnant?
Oh, conversion rate, oh.
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
You got ripped buddy.
Uh, hey buddy.
Oh, Mama.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
I yearn.
"Hey Jimmy"
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
George, we got a problem.
Uh-oh. You're a john.
So, how you feeling?
That's better than we estimated.
Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
So she's coming?
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Well, I don't think they're real.
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
Heey!
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
Egh. These aren't candies.
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
He thinks you're a phony.
(pleased) Really?
Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Hey.
Keep your foot on the gas.
Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
Yeah yeah.
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
I told you she liked me.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
You can't get it from that.
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Yeah.
Well, Im taking this back.
What's going on?
Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
The machine. You want one?
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
A couple of hours ago.
(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
So what's up, Diggity Dog?
Uh, well there was an incident.
I said how come it's takin' so long?
That's pretty good, huh?
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
Just take one.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Thanks man.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
Have we been intimate?
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
Yeah.
That's gunna be trouble.
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
Hey, Jerry.
Pass the cream.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Yeah, well he started it.
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Why, what...?
Want any help?
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
Yeah, it's a windshield.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
Jerry, George got arrested.
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
(smiling) Well...
Yep.
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
No, you told me not to!
Would you be interested?
"What d'you got there?"
I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
Nah.
Elaine
Hey.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
Alright, we'll take the subway.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Don't blame me.
Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right
Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
Naw, that's not my style.
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
Watch out, boy.
(shouts) Hey, peanuts!
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
(shrill) What!?
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
You're on, cowboy!
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
Hey.
You got that straight!
I don't like it.
I'm getting my pot.
It's just...it's no picnic.
Yeah.
Oh, I, I need a pen.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
So I, I didn't do anything wrong.
Sendrax.
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
Got to.
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
I would advise against that.
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.
A kidney stone.
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
That was alright.
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
Well, this is Kramer.
Tony.
How you doing? (Kramer leaves)
It felt like 8 seconds.
Yeah. (Exits)
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
Well I came back for you.
Its over four hundred?
What, they drove to a dealership?
Maybe I outta go over there.
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
Use a belt.
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
My job. What are you doing?
I do?
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Hey, what are you doing here?
Yeah.
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
That's nice..
Really? Feels like Tuesday.
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
$17.50. You can't beat that.
T-t-t-t...
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
Cubed.
Hi. How are you?
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Oh, you don't say.
I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.
Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
You always tell it ..
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
Ok.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
Sister Roberta.
???
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
Oh, come on!
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Why?
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
What about Jerry?
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
Oh, yeah.
But I did sit in mud.
Steven.
Well, what's the matter?
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
Nothin.'
Take me where? Where?
Yeah.
Ya, you have any others?
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
Only in The United States.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Yeah. Newman jumped.
Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
No no. Its all in my head.
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
W...It's four.
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
Well, maybe it's the Oreos.
I'm sorry Jackie.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
I came by to get my ball.
Don't take my money!
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Hey ah.
Mickey, DTs.
Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
That's fine.
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
Im not happy about this.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
Mary Hart!
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Mmmmm.
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Oh come on, You can tell me.
Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Yeah, but I prefer the bro.
Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)
You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
(to Jerry) Hey, howd you do?
Jerry, if the man is in pain...
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
I got mugged.
Talk to me baby.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
NNNN-Giddy-up!
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Is this a joke?
A billiard room.
Aw, you really hurting, huh?
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
You know you're going to.
Yup! Yup!
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
it was your fault
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Well, where is it?
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
Yeah.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
What's the matter?
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
I thought we had a deal?
(He shows her) This umpf thing.
(seeing Jerry is with people) Oh.
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
You wanna go see him?
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Oh...no.
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
Oh, yeah?
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
Alright, I'll call her right now.
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
Hey! (moving a chair onto the set)
Oh, hello.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
[In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Ohhh!
I'm going upstairs.
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
Yeah, I'm an extra.
I'm gonna eat that later.
P B and J's. What d'you think?
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
Which one?
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
(does a double take) Yikes.
(interested) Uh-huh.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
Yeah. Well, he's a dear.
(unbelieving) I can have this?!
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
I always put you up here...
Hey.
We could be tried for murder...
I thought paper covered rock?
Uhummm...
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
Well, I got gonorrhea.
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...
I never take it.
What's wrong?
Hey.
Git.
I know, it's a long story.
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
Serenity! (He exits)
So I'd like to give it to you.
I know how to handle these psychotics.
(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
'felt that the conversation was lagging.
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
Yeah -- yeah.
Break up with her
I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
Huh?
"Go Jimmy"
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
A big phone. A big one.
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
Is it? Look at this.
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
What?!
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
(pause) YEAHH!
That was the wrong card.
Let me taste it.
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Better get that
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
It's not illegal.
(to Jerry) Hey, man.
Hey.
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Euh what...What lot is that?
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Oh, you better believe it.
Yeah, come in.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
(sort of falling backwords) Yowm!
I wouldnt set foot in your house.
I'm in here. How's it going.
Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.
Yeah, merry Christmas.
Relax, he does that all the time.
It's like ten dates in one shot.
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
(low tone)Yeahhehehehe
Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.
Who did?
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
No, I dunno how much duty is.
Boss!
Yeah, see how you're singing?
Hey!
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Yeah. Where's yours?
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
Oh! yeah.
That was a close one.
Hey buddy! Hey!
I don't know!
No you can't, Jerry.
Yea.
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
Yeah!!
Cause they look comfortable.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
Huh?
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
Hey, you seen the paper yet?
I will lose that nail.
Oh yeah!
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
What's Festivus?
Never!
Ma?
You could've introduced me.
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
Aw, c'mon.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
(clattering inside) That wasn't me!
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
Hey, is that T-bone?!
Hey, you got the food?
Oh yeah!
Hey.
Come on...
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
What is this, huh?
Really.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
You got any Ipecac?
Well, Babe Ruth did it.
Oh, uh, well - okay.
Mornin'.
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Read another poem.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
That you Bobby?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Hey, where ya going?
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
They just write it off.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Oh, hello.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
You know, I think you're jealous.
Yes, because they've already deducted it.
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Yeah.
Giddyup.
I dig.
Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)
I knew you would.
Yea, last night.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
Jerry this peach is sub par.
Scared of being shot.
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
Let's go.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
Woah, woah, that's mine.
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
Hey! You ever been in an accident?
Pzzzt. No.
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
How come?
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
I guess I screwed up!
maana I'm doing nada
Who's that?
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
Well, I guess I was..
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
Haircut.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.
Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)
You drank a whole bottle of water.
Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.
What are they doing here?
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
My contention?
(clueless) what is what?
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
That's right.
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Giddy-up!
Fungi.
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Do it. Do it. This.
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
Hey man, what's going on?
Hey.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
Well, I was just trying to help out.
And I need something to write on.
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
ahh.....!!
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
I thought I DID!
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
Take it.
Hello.
Hey.
It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
Jerry.... hey Jeannie.
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Because I don't have a table.
Well, the pleasure's all mine.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
Hey!! Frank just called me. Congratulations.
All right, you're not fancy!
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
What you doing?!
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
I told you this is all I got.
oh, what's that from?
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
Hey, I told you.
City or highway?
yeah
Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
Anything new with that guy on drugs?
Where's the lights. Whoa!
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Get out of here.
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
(approving) Yeah.
What is going on here?
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
(shuts door) "Bailing"?
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
He is just setting the record straight.
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
So , you blew it?
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
Easy Mickey, easy.
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
Real Boss!
Hey buddy. Remember me?
Do you?
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Are too.
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
Who?
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
(abruptly) Well, I'll see you.
Well, this is a surprise ha?
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
So, who is your doctor?
You suffer for your soup.
Yeah.
Yeah.
H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.
(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
Course I will. These are staples.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
Gladly.
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
Oh yeah, you betcha.
You weren't even married yet.
That's what I wanna know.
You know who you are? Even Steven
(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
How did they ever find you?
(to George) What's with you?
My Little Jerry! (Runs out.)
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi
I'm Kramer.
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
What's that smell?
Well I suppose the children do.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
(softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale.
HELLO!
No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat.
Yeah.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
His tooth marks. He bit me.
the rock
Goodnight, Mr Oh.
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Hey.
Okay. What are you getting?
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.
(indicating) You see? You can't let go.
Let me talk to Calvin.
It's macaroni Midler.
(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
Oh I'll be up for it punk.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
All right it's done.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
I have to?
Okay, what do you got?
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
Consolation Guy is big.
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Yeah, youre the punk Im looking for!
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Yay!
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
No paper?
Jerry...
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.
What, again? You took one this morning.
Really?
Oh. Hello.
A hole in one eh.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
Not necessarily.
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
He overcooked it. It's ruined.
I'm dizzy.
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
(from inside) Yeah?
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
Yeah?
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
Huh! You make a higher roof.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Why not? hey what about you George?
So, what do you think?
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
Hmm.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
Yeah?
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
Newman died?
Well, it's a valuable appendage.
(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
Yeah, something like that.
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
(quietly) Hey Jerry.
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Well, we'll see.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
What's the matter with him?
Well, he can't be disturbed now.
What?
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Go ahead, drink it, George.
But you *will* use... a retractor.
I don't know..
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!
What?
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
So played.
No, I got a girl in the next building
Hey, Frank.
Why don't you just give up?
Yeah.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
(quietly) L-l (look)
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
Whoa, you're dating this woman?
Yeah!
It's Halloween (not sure)
What? You're siding with management?!
Right this way, mister Doody!
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
Okay, please! Please tell me!
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
(Pleading) I was all dirty!
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
I must know.
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
Yeah.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
They're never in contention.
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
Yeah, yeah.
Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!
Hey.
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
What guy?
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
"Ah! what.. Tim Whatley?
Its for you.
"You've got something between your teeth"
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
And Buck Showalter's?
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
Hey, he's a terrific guy.
Alright you go ahead.
What test?
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
Well? Did he call?
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Hi.
Heads up!
Hey buddy.
Yeuu.
Um-hm.
Who died?
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
Why?
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
I saw the whole thing!
Well I'm boycotting it.
Alright.
You shoulda come, Jerry.
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
Patience.
How you doing?
Uh, 42.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
(Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
George, do me a solid? Two minutes.
Unh.... Sorry.
Hips! See, its all hips.
It's just me.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
Yeah. What dog?
You're in a weird mood.
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
Steve Gendason.
That's right.
It's Phil's.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
Well I don't remember that part.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
All right, I'll take Julie.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
I liked Marlene. Whats her number?
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
What happened to the car?
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
Hey.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
NEWMAN ! Stop it!!
Hahaa!
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Wow.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
But it's Festivus.
(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
That's true.
And we're off.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
Oh, great ride.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Me?
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Oh, yeah?
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
You can smell me without the drink.
So why don't you just go?
There are no delicatessens under Communism.
What is it?
Yey eye ca-catfight.
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
Yeah.
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
I don't like her.
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?
You did.
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
Well!
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
I'm here to talk about the ocean.
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
"Hey!"
Yep.
Buenos dias.
Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
Hey buddy.
Apparently.
Jerry, the whole building is brick.
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
Oh, yes.
(momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
I got it! This time, I got it!
Oh yeah!
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
(RE CAR) I found it!
(quiet) Oh.
Ohh, it's real.
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Turn on the TV.
No, no, no. I looked.
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
But that's not Hello.
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
(leaving) Aw.
Roger that.
No, no, I would turn you in.
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Hey! Mike!
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
May I..( pointing her food)
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing)
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
What did this guy do? What happened?
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
Wha? Where?
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
Newman! Hes good friends with him.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
Oh no, I don't think so.
(makes his pop sound) There you go.
Well, just tell me everything, huh?
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
Oh? Who's Leo?
Hey, George, stick 'em up.
Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Well, ah you were right.
Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?
Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
Youre flesh and blood.
Bet? Um, not betting.
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Rock.
He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
Cash.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Hey.
(Excited) Done!
How about Idi Amin, huh?
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
Why not?
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
Heyahhh!
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
Wet and wild.
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
How's your evening?
Ahh.
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
Yeah, well, no good?
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
You should sleep with him.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
Yes she is...
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
Well, where's the soup?
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
You guys ready?
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
Why?
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Oh, and that voice!
What do you mean, a broad noodle?
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
Heh.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
Well, thank you.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
I too am well.
Yes.
HUAAHHH!!
Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
(to door) Gah!
(from inside) Security issue!
Ooo Paella
The *beach*!
What's going on?
Well, he started it!
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
I was never able to become a banker.
I got them too.
(in pain) Ow! Jeez!
Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?
YAH! (exits)
Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?
Yeah, yeah.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
And yet, he's my friend.
Hey, Brody!
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Really?
Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
Remember I told you about the bank?
Hey. It's really wet out there.
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Why?
Hey.
No? That's good.
I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.
Really?
Look, let me handle this.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
What's a Chow Fung?
(emotionally) She's deep.
I expect you both to be there.
C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Excuse me.
Huh?
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
No no no, well, then who was it?
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
(yells) Elaine!
Whe have the same symptoms.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
Hello?
No, no, no.
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.
No! I'm not the Assman.
You know I'm in that movie?
Hey.
This is the best way to go!
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
I don't know.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
Those people, listen to yourself.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
Oh. Delicious to meet you.
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
Well, he was a little standoffish.
Wait, wait, wait...
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
(Squirming) Jerry! What?!
(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
Well, he's still a conductor.
Well I'm a guest.
(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Elaine.
Yeah.
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
Good idea.
Why?
Hey, buddy.
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
What is that?
Sure do.
Wha...?
What?
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Yeah. Move along, Betty.
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
The factory?
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Okay...
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
All right, so we let the girls decide.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
No, Jerry!
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
(quietly) Hey, Jerry.
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
Jeez!
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?
George, they closed up.
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
Well, he didn't say (leaves).
A bris? You mean circumcision?
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
Rock.
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
(stops Mickey) Alright, come on.
Oh. Come on.
A stall man, huh? (small laugh)
Gonorrhea!
Hey, you got any matches?
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
Yeah.
Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!
Yeah. That's them.
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
Ok, I'll go with you.
Look away, I'm hideous.
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
No, No You said Hey!
(interested) Well, how do you do?
Alright, but no bites.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
Oh I'm down.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
This ramp is steep.
I can't believe I didn't see it.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Liked me.
Do I think? He's repugnant.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
(leaves, upset) Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
Its good to have you back, Stan.
Yeah, here it is... yeah.
All right, get off at the next exit.
You should just eat fruit.
Awright, I got it.
Freeze, mother!
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
That's right.
Bugger!
O.K.!
Meet, the bro.
But I'm tired..
No, no, I got it.
(looking down, nodding) Hi.
You're not pregnant?
We'll see you Dwayne.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
Yeah.
See, that's why I don't want to.
Double?
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
Well, yeah...
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
There was no plan.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
Bad news, my friend.
You? You're getting old.
No, no, I'm working on it.
No, of course not. (winks back)
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
Well, get him to bark.
No.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
Hi Mr. Clotworthy
I see.
Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
Here, take one.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
Woah, woah, come on.
No, a thousand!
That's right
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
Hey.
Well, thats a weird thing to say
No. No, Elaine!
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
I may be old, but I'm spry.
Mama!
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
Yaaaa.
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
No sweat.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
Deal?
Mr. O'Neill?
..you know, very casually,
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
(realisation) Mother's Day.
C'mon , c'mon what's the matter?
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
(entering Monk's) Hey, you guys.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
Yeah. He's intense, man.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
You ever seen Michael Jordan?
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
Yeah, I love going to the country.
What's going on?!
"Hey! Got the new Penthouse"
No, I got 'em in the ocean.
Oh yeah? What about?
Would you like a refund?
Yeah.
Gu-gu- cada-
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
Oh, memory burn.
I tell you.
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
Hey, you got a hammer?
Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.
You got anything on the horizon?
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
It's weighing on my conscience.
George I told you we're booked!
Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.
What?
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
The AC is on it's way.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Uh huh.
Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
All right, lets go.
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
Hey.
George, I thought that was the door.
I got fired from the movie.
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
That's correct.
There they are.
Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Hey, buddy. How was career day?
I told you, I threw it out.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
I gotta find another shower.
Well, doesn't he need that?
Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
HE..YA. AYA. AYYYYYAAAAA!!!!
Me?
Yeah! Well, are you going out?
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Jerry!
Yeah, well, that was a good one.
Yeah.
Jerry, where have you been?
Uh, yes. Yeah.
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
What? What are you talking about?
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
(shocked) How can you not have insurance?
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
There you go.
Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
Yeah? Eva?
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
What tonight?
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Yeah.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
He's in jail.
Toxic gas!!!
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
Hey!
No, it didn't say anything.
Hey!
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
Who's that?
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.
Yeah...
...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
That's weird.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
You killed.
Well, we're not very close.
Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
When does it start?
Yeah, I turned up the heat.
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Was it more than just one?
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
What is that a Titleist?
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
Come on. What'd he say?
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
Buddy Hackett?
Oh now you don't want my business.
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
Barry?
No.
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
Oh, mama...
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
I sure am.
I'll show ya Rusty.
Ohhhh, what's this?
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
(suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Well, you're getting heavy.
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
The party, Long Island?
Over there. The Dominicans.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Ah!
Bennette right?
who?
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?
Hey.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Woah! Wait!
Hey you got it.
Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
I thought it was here.
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!
Lock and load.
I'm in here. C'mon...
That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Of what?
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
Yeah.
You can move in with me, if you want.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
Sue her?
Look at this place. It's huge...
What? What?
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Oh, you're poo-pooing!
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
Oh. I'll lug.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
No.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
AH! I don't want her disturbed.
You've been married three times.
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
(yells) Newmanniun!!
Maybe she's bulimic
Its all supervised.
You gotta go.
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
Why?!
No...
(shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja
First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
Well then, what did you do next?
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Oh, yes, I am.
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
(doing the voice) La la la.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
I'm watching your door.
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
No.
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
No, it doesn't work.
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
You've been warned.
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
Yeah.
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
Joes?
What?
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
Hey, did that guy show up?
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
Remember this?
Yeah, a player...
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
(Confused) What?
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
No.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.
Didnt Elaine call you?
What?
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
All right, all right, come on, now.
Well open the door, you get a better look.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Yeah, so whats the problem?
Oh yeah - oui oui.
What?
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Ah, people in this city are crazy.
They want to know why they never see you.
How can I possibly thank you?
Well, that's good news.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
Mint?
She does fine work.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
That's NBC.
Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
They're trying to screw with your head.
Jerry, he probably had a cold.
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Yeah.
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
Oh, yeah.
Defective.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
I don't want this on my conscience.
"Ohhh H'am loaded."
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
"Yeah"
You're all right
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
You scream good.
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
Oh, no.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Oh, I'll be back.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
Yeah!
Hey! Anybody home? Oh boy.
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
I don't have anything. Ask him.
All right, geez. You're crazy.
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Right here at the mall.
What?
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Hey, you know who owns that car?
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
What?
DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
(overly excited) Hey (Claps hands one time)
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Good luck with that.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
South America?
Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
That's a fallacy.
You got money?
So, what are you saying?
"Hi Gwen, hi tide."
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
Yeah, that's right. You did.
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
Hey.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
Are you guys ready?
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Well what are you doing here?
Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.
Ah ha!
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
The Maestro.
Of course, yes.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
Oooow! He's biting me!
What are you all dressed up for?
I am dressed.
Hey.
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
(pointing) That's her, officer.
Oh
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Really.
Hey! JoJo!
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
Sorry.
Oh, lots of 'em.
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
We played Backgammon in the nude.
Well I won them anyway.
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
Ya.
"What!!!"
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
Uh, no, no, not yet.
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Oh I got the ball.
He's lying.
Look, she didn't mean anything.
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
Pffft - wrong.
Con dios? Well, that's rude.
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
Aahh...Who's Janet?
Heey.
what?
Yeah.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)
I just assume not sit next to you.
Okay, how much?
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
His mudda' was a mudda'.
What, youre not gonna tell me?
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
It changes the molecules.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
George! George!
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
Yeah.
I don't care, whatever.
Yeah.
I never had an air conditioner.
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over.
Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
Well, that's how cats do it.
No kidding.
I don't wanna go back on there!
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
So go. GEORGE Here?
I wouldn't walk over there.
What did you do?
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
yep.
Why not?
Eh! Come on. What did you say?
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
I've been thinking about something.
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Elaine?
Doc, huh?
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
Hey
Oh, yeah.
Disaster.
Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.
(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
I'm goin' to Newman's!
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
I don't know.
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
The pharmacy's still open.
He's holistic, George. He's holistic.
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
Elaine?
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
(shouts) Connie!
You know Frank, you could take a break.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
No, lets go to the couch...
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
Let's go!
That's a lotta yearning, huh?
Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
Oh! Come on.
Hoochie moochie. (haha)
Hey
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
(stops) W--Reggie Miller.
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!
That's right. He's a troublemaker.
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
You said it, sister.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Aah! Aah! Mama!
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...
Mickey Mantle.
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
Yeah, maybe not technically, but
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
(quietly, to himself) Look at this.
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
You don't know what you're missing buddy.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
Do you ever yearn?
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
1937, 1937, 1937...
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
I'll be down in a minute.
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Yes I am.
Maestro.
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
10-4.
How come you never said anything?
Hey I know how to sign.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
Ya I didn't know you could cook.
You can get that in your arms?
Retail is for suckers.
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
Smile, everyone! We're back!
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
Oh, guess again, Tubby!
Put that on the top of your list.
Oh yeah, I?m selling.
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
I'm sorry.
Beg me.
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
Well, you should, Jerry.
Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
It's this way.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
what?
Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
That's it.
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
You gonna throw this out?
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
it was a big rock
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
What happened?!
I'm the real Peterman.
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
Well,
Ah-huh.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
"What?"
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
Antonio. In here!
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
Well if they're lucky.
Hi guys.
(to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!
Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
What happened?
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
No, blame me.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Done.
Lit _ tle Jer _ ry!
Sister Roberta gave it to me.
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
So...
Yeah. Nice meeting you.
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
A mouse!
Jeannie left?
(claps hands) Yes indeed.
Well, that is strange.
Exclamation point.
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
What?!
Hey.
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
Yello?
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
When you getting it back?
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
I like what you've done with that.
what about?
Oh... yeah...
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Yallo. What delay industries?
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Yeah, stir it up so it melts.
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
Hey, are you performing tomorrow?
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
For what?
Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
Independence Day?
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
I wanna be a pirate.
[In Newman's ear] Make us.
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.
Paella, ya I'll be there.
I think we lost him.
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
Mmm... Nice wallet.
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
Wha, you too?
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
Oh, well, yeah, it's good.
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Got any coffee?
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.
Ok, but I got this...
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
No.
Cmon, George. I saw it first.
Yeah. How'd it go?
Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
No, I didn't see him.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
Hi.
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
I sure am.
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
Open it, it's from Hallmark.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
I thought you said it was a scratch.
(yelling) DARREN!
Awright, my work is done here.
No. He doesn't know.
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Hey, what's going on?
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.
Yeah.
I tell you how much I make.
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
Hey!
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
OK. Let's turn the water on now.
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
Stefanie. 2-G.
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
Uh, well, uh, we --
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
Oh, I'm the real deal.
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
What?s his message like?
Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.
(noise)
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
Yes I did.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
Well, I didn't believe you.
Are they war veterans?
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
(claps hands) So ...
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
(CALLING OUT) Jerry!
Yo-yo Ma!
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Where do you turn it on?
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
Racquet.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Yeah?
Hey.
Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.
I love you, too, buddy, and George--
It's Pagliacci!
Yeah, me, too.
It was on the seat...
Did you bring the video camera?
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!
Come on. Where'd you go?
Yeah. That's Rusty.
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Na, I am down
Oh bold and beautiful.
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
You called me?
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
Yo
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Quone. To quone something.
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
Well, you're pregnant.
Thats you.
What advice would you give young people?
Yeah I could have helped you out.
Well, I guess I just assumed.
What are you looking for?
She was flouting.
Hey buddy.
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
Well, coffee tables.
What?
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
Do you want more pastrami?
Quality time.
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!
I need the yield sign.
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
Elaine?
I don't know.
Yeah, right...
Hey.
Yah-hey.
I'm not going back in there!!
That's... even better!
Awright, hands up, porky!
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
Devola came after me.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
Excellent question.
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
How serendipitous.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Hey.
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
Ooh, I like that.
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
I don't know.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
Why doesn't he just move in here?
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
Y'ello?
Sure. I will.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
Psst. Hey.
Have you ever met my guys?
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
What, again with you?
What, is it for a job or something?
You didn't hear?
Oh yeah!!
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
I, I saw her naked.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
Ive got the Kavorka Jerry.
(Snaps) The Place To Be!
Yeah, so?
Look how dark it's gettin' already.
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Because we're engaged.
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
Whatever you get.
Hey, eh, Lew!
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.
What is what?
Oh, COME ON!
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
(hesitant) Uhm...
(like rainman)"Yeah! heading home."
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
Yeah.
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?
Jerry, George!
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
What time does that play start?
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
Well I got it!
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Mickey!
Well, wow.
No, no! My car's not running.
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
What's doing?
(smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
He's the *phone* man!
Well, why not?
It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
Hey.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
How could you not think about it?
Uh huh. Your back hurt?
What time do you need it at?
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
Why not?
What banking?
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
If they're real, that's Rushdie.
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
Out.
Need any help with those?
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
And..voila!
Awe check it out.
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
Are too.
Yeah, but did you tape it?
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
that's her
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
Well these seats have no lumbar.
Yeah, what time is it?
Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
Oh, not a problem.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
(Together) Sucker..
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
What?
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
There's no problem, really.
(Interested) That's perfect.
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
I cant believe hes in a coma.
Thank you.
Alright, what size are you?
Hey, where's Jerry?
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
Hey.
It's got to be here.
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Are those shoes comfortable?
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
(low tone) All right, yeah.
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?
Yes.
Look look.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
Now what's that?
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
It's not going to happen again!
Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
He jumped.
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
I hear you.
Oh yeah.
Commando 8 has arrived!
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.
I want to capture this.
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
Pretty good, huh?
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Most of them don't even have batteries.
Uh? Oh that must be it.
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah!
A picture.
You can have this one.
Hah?
(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
I don't know it's up to you.
All the time?
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
(playing with his hair) Talk to him.
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
A pig-man. Half pig, half man!
Yeah, no kidding.
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
(Ow!) It's my stomach.
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
Will you relax?!
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
Yeah,
Didn't we come in over there?
Ya.
So Heather called?
You begged me.
Arrest?
"Whooo!"
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Yeah let me borrow your scarf.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
I didn't even know they were defective.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
Well, I practically raised his kids.
(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
So, you're still master of your domain.
So, you up next?
You gave up the voice?
He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
What? What? What? Tell me.
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
Come on, try it on.
Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
I think I hit my head again!
I didn't say anything.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
I'd like to get some coffee.
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
Mousse. I moussed up.
No, no, no.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
Oh, that's a prickly one.
Well, I was just--
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
Hey.
Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
I only got hundreds.
Run, run! Go, go, go!
All righty...
Well, I can't!
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
I dont understand.
Its beautiful.
Hey, Clyde!
How often do you cut your toe nails?
Hey, man. Enjoy the food?
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Yeah-yah.
I don't know.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Well, yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
Yes, that's my contention.
Go ahead, drink it, George.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
But you haven't seen..
What card?
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
You Gack?
(as he leaves with it) Crackers.
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
Ooh, she's a package full of energy!
Whoa, back up a second.
Hey, our meat problems are solved.
Heyy! Look who's here.
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
Hey!
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
Why, what's the difference?
He almost beat me.
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
I'm not going if he's going.
Oh. Oh, George.
(theatrical) I made a mistake.
(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.
Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
They're all looking up.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
What else?
No chance in hell!
Oh, thank you.
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
(shivering) I don't know.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Oh hey!
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
You looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Jerry. Hey Jerry?
I lost my balance.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
I can't taste this.
"So... Did you take a look?"
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
Oh?
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
Ah, Yeah. uh...
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Oh I can be quite litigious.
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Phew!
No, don't, don't make me
They got you too?
Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
All right
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
Yeah.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
You wanna rent a movie?
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
Yeah.
Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
Yo yo ma.
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
Yei-
Yeah.
Junior Mints. Do you want one?
yeah
I got a quality.
That's right.
Alright, lean forward, relax.
Oh, tell me about it.
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
Hang on.
Well, yeah.
That's for radiation.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
Hi Todd.
Yeah.
Oh, like you're gonna stop?
Yeah.
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
Huh?
Taste this.
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
Yes, yes I am.
Now, it's called the bro.
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
An In The Park Home Run!
Then we're cool.
This was set for 2 minutes. See?
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Now, you see, that's nice.
(Declaring) I'm out!
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
Jerry too, of course.
You didn't get the blood from me.
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
HELLO!
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
hey George, hear that?
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
It's Kramer!
Oh, Ill be comfortable.
You are one sick mama I like it.
What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
Thats as good as anything you do.
That smell. What's that smell?
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
No, no, no, I didnt.
Duty.
It was supposed to erupt.
Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
Oh? How do you figure?
Ooh tattle tale
(Complaining) No more golf.
Oh, alrighty uh...
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
Poor Lily..
Does your girlfriend have to be here?
Uh... great.
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
Jackie we gotta talk.
you know I think you are in love with him
Yeah, I'm going to poke around...
Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
Ok, it's forgotten.
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
Ya!
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
We'll order Chinese.
Is this the interference?
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Well, would I be able to communicate?
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Well did you mention my name?
Those kids look pretty disappointed.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
That kid is gonna be all right.
I don't want to!
Name's Kramer.
Really, Ah,
Why are we slowing down?
Rock, paper, scissors match.
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
Yeah, uh.
Shall we go?
No! Don't!
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Just show me the cheque, c'mon.
That's East River.
Jerry, what is your problem?
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
Lets go get him.
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
oh oh oh oh oh
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
(Flattered) Oh?
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Let me have her number.
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
No.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
What? Where are we going?
Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
Well, that's a little strange.
What bachelor auction?
All right then, what was it?
Aaaahhh...!!!
No, that's no good. I'm leaving.
Uh huh.
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
George, you gonna buy a painting?
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
You awake?
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
Well, I'm gonna type it up.
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
So!
Got any Double Crunch?
What is it blowing up?
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Here you go.
You got a dog?
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Yeow!
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Well, we'll have to improvise.
Well let's sit down.
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
No. That's bush league.
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Oh - I'm familiar with it.
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
Cigars? (hits the box)
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Well that's weird
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
(guiltily) The door.
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
(surprise) What?
Come on, one lap around.
(cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
Oh, yeah! Me.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Yeah, about two hours.
I say we get him.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
I told you.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
What do you mean?...
(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
All right
Whoa, psychosexual.
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
Hi.
What?
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
What?
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
How 'bout zero?
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
Any news?
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
I like to strain the sauce.
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
Hey! (Group does likewise)
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
Pine is good.
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Oh, come on.
(rips open package) Yeah, that's...
It's good suspension!
New cards, huh?
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Hey, how about that Toby, huh?
Well, I'm a poppa.
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
You're joking.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
Yeah,
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
Tryin' to save a quarter.
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
What's that?
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
What
Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
She kissed me back.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
(CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.
So, huh?
Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
All right, what is your deductible?
Jerry
Well, it's uh, common courtesy.
What, he's not here yet?
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
Hey!
You get the tickets?
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Jerry, I'll take care of it.
I didn't realize it was a full box.
So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
What, they don't like me?
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
I don't know about that outfit though.
George is saying "Cut it."
What happened to Newman?
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
Would you?
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
No
Whatever it takes.
You got any of those mini Ritzes?
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
Boy...
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Lets see what Jerry has to eat.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
A big fat turkey.
Hey.
George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti
You don't say?
(enters) Well.
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
I thought she was pregnant.
Oh, yow, oow Ah!
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
I like mangos.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
Ma!
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
That's true. That's right.
Yes, that's true.
What's so funny? ... wha?
yeaaaaah!
Yeah that's right.
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
More? More than three thousand?
Sure.
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
It's an eyepatch.
(To Driver) Hey, let me drive.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
No, they never heard of him.
what?
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!
Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
Hello, I'm Kramer.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Well hello Photo store Sheila.
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
I told you I was gonna get it.
Can I sleep with you?
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
(proffering) Here, try this pair.
Yeah.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
Oh, I get by.
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
No, no. A bra is for ladies.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
His cat's gone.
(Thinks) 1500 dollars.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
Mickey
No, Julie. She's the one.
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
What's an extremity?
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Yeah,I had a tough day
Cosmo Kramer.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
Wait a second. I can get change.
Well, you won't regret it.
Well, Ill think of something.
Tell me about it.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back--
Whoa!
What's the matter with you?
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
You just blew my mind.
Don't step on anything.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
(does a double take) It's too busy
What?
Nestl's Quik!
I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
Same old, same old.
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
Hi, Mike.
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin.
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
All right, I'll see you guys.
Oh, everybody's your type.
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
(chuckles)
Yeah.
I'm asking you!
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
Oh, I love curls.
Neither are you.
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Yea.
Bye!!
Oh, I really think you're wrong.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!
Erika, she's Erika
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
The tobacco companies.
Polio?
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
Well, how did they get your face?
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
You're *not*!!!
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
The only way to fly.
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
It's just Original, Jerry!
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
Oh, well, thank you.
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
Yeah, a real brouhaha...
Bombs away (Uh oh).
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
Ooh, it's a big one!
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
Hmm. That's a shame.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
Hello, boys and girls.
OK, OK-
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
Hey, see, I like it like this.
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
well she says Jane
Well, what about your deal, huh?
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
Hey.
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
Uh, no thanks.
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
It was an accident.
Yeah.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
Blood!
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
Cat fight?
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
You got the paper yet?
What's happenin' here?
Wha-huh-wha-huh...
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...
Go ahead smell, smell
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
It's Pam.
Be realistic George.
How long are you staying?
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
No. At your apartment.
I know how to sign.
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
What happened?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
Wrong again.
Ooh Mama...( walks away)
So, so what do you want me to do?
I have no concentration!
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
Hmm.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
Back and to the left
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
"What kind?"
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Can't help ya, kid.
Mansiere?
That's what they gave me.
Oh, tough crowd.
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Bania?
I'll bet I can guess it.
It's Keith.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
Ok.
Well, I beg to differ...
Uh-huh.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
Vandelay.
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Oh, you have no idea.
Get outta here.
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
Yeahh. I owe you one.
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
Right.
enters
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
...All right ..Starting now......
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
No no, he's fine.
Oh, yeah.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
Well, you can get 'em back.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
We're gonna be right there.
No, they're good! Take one..
Sure, do you need a glove?
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
Quo? Thats not a word.
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
Gail Cunningham.
You keep him busy.
No! She needs it now!
Talk to me.
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
(immaturely) I guess.
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
How do you know?
Is too.
Hey.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
Lindsay olives, Jerry.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
You got any shredded coconut?
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
All right, listen. I need some cash.
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha.
Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
It would put me at ease.
Oh,
What do ya mean?
Yeah, went straight to video.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
Hey.
It was easy the last time.
It's got an alarm that beeps!
Oh, there's leg work.
Drive the horse?
Do you have any prospects?
yeah!
(smelling) What's burning?
Power, man. Power.
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
OH! GOD HELP US!!!
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
Oh, congratulations.
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Oh, you better believe it!
She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
Well, you'd better take it easy.
"Hey! What's this?"
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
That's caged heat.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.
Yeah, yeah. I think he will.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Just a little burning during urination.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
It's pronounced thermometer.
What?
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
Oh, he's cold.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
Yeah.
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
Now calm down, Mr. Fields...
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
Bald?
(to Frank) I told you.
This slicer is indomitable.
I told you he could do it.
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
Yeah.
Oh yeah right it's raining.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
GO! GO!!
Any word from Nana?
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
(an idea occurs) You don't say.
Talkin' to that woman.
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
Spleenectomy.
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
Yeah.
Uh, let's see... well.
Who's Gennice?
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Hey! You're back!
Well, then I was way off!
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
Alright, I'm down.
Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
Wha-- Oh, hey.
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
(from outside) Hello?
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
No, taste it. Taste it.
Hey.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
No.
Hey, Elaine.
Huh?
Well, that guy who yelled out.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
So THAT's how it's going to be
Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.
You're making a big mistake.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
Why, why? Why does she get it?
Uh-huh. Its good?
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
What?
South America?
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Whoa, I'm Kramer.
Well, it's my final offer.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
(somewhat under his breath) Ya ya.
(Wiggling and floppin) Pull Down
(answering) PBS pledge drive.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.
Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
Oh, it's true.
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
That's queer uh?
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
So now he wants her more than ever!
Hey, how's it goin'?
Help me Father. Help me.
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
Oh, the one with the crest.
Oh yeah (quietly)
What is this, oregano?
Is your name Ray?
Well, I don't want to either.
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
I just need it, that's all.
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
Oohh.
Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
I'm fried.
No.
Are you kidding me?
Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!
Yeah.
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
Yeah, there's something in the air.
What's up?
Lomez, Im Leavin
What am I supposed to say?
(puzzled) I think so.
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
Alright, so you're gonna look after it?
I don't have it, I threw it out.
Well, I can guess within an hour.
what is this?
YEA!
Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.
Five bucks???
Like the big toe captain..
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
No. You got a point.
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
From you?
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Hey.
(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
Uh, did you?
Really?
If you like her, go talk to her.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Now, where's that tool shed of yours?
Its funny.
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Eh! Bingo.
Feel it.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Uh-huh.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
Mmm
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
Okay...yea well uh start with me.
Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
Ge--
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
You're scared of Elaine?
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
HUAAHHH!!
Hey, Frank!
Which one?
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.
Hey.
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
No! Never.
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
(Confused) What is up with you two?
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
Well, don't look at me.
What dog?
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Well, I know what they feel like.
No. Don't, Jerry.
No no no. End of the month.
Another Festivus miracle!
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
Because we're blind to their tyranny.
Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.
Aah!
(quietly) Um-hm.
You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
My old one sprung a leak.
Oh.
Well, It's quite a thrill.
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
Double exclamation point!
What happened there?
Yeah.
No, I'm the baby-sitter.
There's Salman.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
Nothing.
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
So you don't think it's a good idea?
I'm calling Jerry.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.
Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?
Joey, there you are. Hey
The name on the boat. Look at it.
I was going to dump this.
Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.
No, no, I'm off that.
Hey.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
How bout me, Jackie?
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
All of it. You want to invest?
Quiet, quiet.
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
Who is it?
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
Oh, stop saying 'reneging".
What about the baby?
Yeah, alright...
Sell it, just say Im selling!
Oh, yeah.
He's gonna make us very happy.
Well at least there's no traffic.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
Hey.
No, not these. These were real hooters.
Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
Ah, you're making too much of it.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
What happened to the doll?
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
Damn!
I thought you said she stinks
Ooh, cereal bowls.
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
Oh yes
No, no. Your not playing the game.
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
Come on, let's go to the beach.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah.
Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
Bania, you're killing me.
Do you like tsimmis?
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
Yeah.
Why, what's wrong with bro?
Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum.
Well--
It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
Yeah.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
Too much?!
Well, what have you been doing?
Yeah--
Hey.
You didnt want her in the building?
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
Hi.
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
Oh, yes indeed...
Movie?
Nothin'.
Well, I tell time by the sun.
"How?"
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
Yeah-
It's a business.
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
(mumbling with full mouth) No, Im good.
Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Hey! Jerry!
Oh, hey.
Hey you!
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
You better believe it.
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
Oooh, lobsters.
Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose.
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Vaguely.
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.
Well, they're slim-fit.
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!
Hey, now, they're tough cookies.
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
You got that straight.
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Huh? I don't?
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
Huh, Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
Ms. Welch.
Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?
Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.

Well, they're in...
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)

Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?

Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
No, five. But you were close.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
Hey, McNab!
Ooo!
I didn't know.
Stay strong buddy.
Not just someone. Jon Voight.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Nope. No good.
Whoa!
Oh.
Well, now look, just leave me alone.
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
What?
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
Look, just meet with him. ?????.

Very... much...
(cries out) WELL I SAID I'M SORRY."
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
Hi
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
"What!"
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Hey!
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
... Cou, ye, ge...
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
No. It belongs to the British.
What?
Yeah, nice to meet you.
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
It was an accident.
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
Are you through?
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
So you don't know where you got 'em?
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.
Oh, I gotcha (clicks)
You just answered your own question.
Jerry, that's in Sweden.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
(laughing) He he, yeah.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Three quarters of a tank.
(not understanding him) Hey, thanks.
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
Yeah.
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
Yeah, I snuck a peak.
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Um, Uh, ugh, ...
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
It's a sweater.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
This truck is dying. We're losing him.
(waving wing) Hey buddy.
I thought I heard you.
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
Don't you get tired of following rules?
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Yowza yowza. Check it out.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
Tuesday? Uh...
Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..
You're wasting your life.
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Hey, what are you doing?
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Double or nothin'.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
Hey, that's supposed to be great.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
Well?
Uh-huh.
And she doesn't know anything, about this?
Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
(To Jerry) Yates.
Jerry he's a conductor.
I'm going.
(waving) Shellbach.
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
Oh, he ran away.
All right.
Uh.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
