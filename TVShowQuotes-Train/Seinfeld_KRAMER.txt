Let's just take a bus back to the city.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
So, so what do you want me to do?
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
Put that on the top of your list.
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
So you don't know where you got 'em?
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
And you're going to go out with her.
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
I told you this is all I got.
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
All right, get off at the next exit.
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
Not as many as there used to be.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
No, no. She put a stop to that.
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
No, I got a girl in the next building
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
When we went to dinner the other night.
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
All right, so we let the girls decide.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
You are one sick mama I like it.
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
I told you I sold them to Bania.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
I may have to drive that place out of business.
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Well you can go to your room and read.
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
No. And now I can't get it back.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
Well, I think one of us should leave.
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
Well no, I don't have them on me.
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
I didn't realize it was a full box.
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
If you like her, go talk to her.
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
No, I want you to see me naked.
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
I told you I was gonna get it.
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
I just assume not sit next to you.
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
So you don't think it's a good idea?
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
They want to know why they never see you.
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
The name on the boat. Look at it.
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
I go in front first all the time.
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Why would you think I would invite him?
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
I was never able to become a banker.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
I don't have it, I threw it out.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
They wont take a cage full of birds.
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
So now he wants her more than ever!
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
You can move in with me, if you want.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
Why were you holding the door open for?
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
What, is it for a job or something?
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
I got it! This time, I got it!
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
Well, this has all been one big tease!
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
I said how come it's takin' so long?
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
you know I think you are in love with him
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
No no no, well, then who was it?
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
Well, I was just trying to help out.
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
I thought you said it was a scratch.
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
I drank too much water in the shower.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
All right George, come on, take a look.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
So, what do you think? Does this work?
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
You know Frank, you could take a break.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Darren is going away for a long long time.
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
If only I could say things like that around her.
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
Well open the door, you get a better look.
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
