No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
When we went to dinner the other night.
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
You know Frank, you could take a break.
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
What, is it for a job or something?
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
If you like her, go talk to her.
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
Well, I think one of us should leave.
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
So you don't think it's a good idea?
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
You mind if I use it in my book?
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
You know I never got a library card.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
I got it! This time, I got it!
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
I thought you said it was a scratch.
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
Well, I got the hell out of there.
I go in front first all the time.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
So, so what do you want me to do?
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
Why would you think I would invite him?
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
You gotta come through with the hips first.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
Well open the door, you get a better look.
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
So you don't know where you got 'em?
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
Well, this has all been one big tease!
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
No, no. She put a stop to that.
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
I didn't realize it was a full box.
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
They want to know why they never see you.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
I told you I was gonna get it.
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
All right George, come on, take a look.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
I may have to drive that place out of business.
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
They wont take a cage full of birds.
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
How often do you cut your toe nails?
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
Well you can go to your room and read.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
I drank too much water in the shower.
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
No no no, well, then who was it?
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
you know I think you are in love with him
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
Not as many as there used to be.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
I told you I sold them to Bania.
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
No, I want to speak to the manager.
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
Put that on the top of your list.
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
The name on the boat. Look at it.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
So now he wants her more than ever!
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
Well, I was just trying to help out.
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
Darren is going away for a long long time.
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
No, I want you to see me naked.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
I don't have it, I threw it out.
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
I told you this is all I got.
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
I just assume not sit next to you.
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
If only I could say things like that around her.
No. And now I can't get it back.
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
You can move in with me, if you want.
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
And you're going to go out with her.
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
I was never able to become a banker.
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
You are one sick mama I like it.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
So, what do you think? Does this work?
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
Well no, I don't have them on me.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
