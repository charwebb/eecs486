I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
So you don't think it's a good idea?
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
All right, get off at the next exit.
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
Well, I got the hell out of there.
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
I didn't realize it was a full box.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
You can move in with me, if you want.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
They wont take a cage full of birds.
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
Well, this has all been one big tease!
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
You are one sick mama I like it.
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
Well you can go to your room and read.
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
How 'bout if I put a few things --
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
I said how come it's takin' so long?
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
So, what do you think? Does this work?
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
You mind if I use it in my book?
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
No, no. She put a stop to that.
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
Well, I was just trying to help out.
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
You know I never got a library card.
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
I was never able to become a banker.
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
No, I want to speak to the manager.
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
What, is it for a job or something?
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
And you're going to go out with her.
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
What would be the point in taking the water?
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
If only I could say things like that around her.
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
I drank too much water in the shower.
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
How often do you cut your toe nails?
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
you know I think you are in love with him
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
I may have to drive that place out of business.
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
If you like her, go talk to her.
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
You gotta come through with the hips first.
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
So, so what do you want me to do?
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
When we went to dinner the other night.
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
No, I got a girl in the next building
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
I don't have it, I threw it out.
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
The name on the boat. Look at it.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
I told you I was gonna get it.
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Well no, I don't have them on me.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
So whats going on between you and Gina?
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
I told you this is all I got.
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Dont you know what that does to suede?
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
All right George, come on, take a look.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
So you don't know where you got 'em?
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
No. And now I can't get it back.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Well, I think one of us should leave.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
I just assume not sit next to you.
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
Not as many as there used to be.
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
I got it! This time, I got it!
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
No no no, well, then who was it?
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
I told you I sold them to Bania.
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
So now he wants her more than ever!
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
So I'd like to give it to you.
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
Why were you holding the door open for?
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
I go in front first all the time.
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
They want to know why they never see you.
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
You know Frank, you could take a break.
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
I thought you said it was a scratch.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
Put that on the top of your list.
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
No, I want you to see me naked.
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
