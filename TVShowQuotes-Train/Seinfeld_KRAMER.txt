No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
I didn't realize it was a full box.
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
Well no, I don't have them on me.
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
(still under the effects of the Novocaine slurrs his words heavily) "Yeah H'amon board."
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
You can move in with me, if you want.
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
Well, I was just trying to help out.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it.
Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.
You know, you should make yourself throw up.
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
"Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language."
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
I said how come it's takin' so long?
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing.
Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
If you like her, go talk to her.
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
You know Frank, you could take a break.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
I thought you said it was a scratch.
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)
Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
So you don't know where you got 'em?
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
Well, I got the hell out of there.
No, I want you to see me naked.
All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
I told you I sold them to Bania.
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
I told you this is all I got.
(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
"Go ahead, go ahead you got it......(to the driver) He's got it."
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
Why would you think I would invite him?
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
No, I want to speak to the manager.
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
How often do you cut your toe nails?
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
Come on, I want to see how it fits.
Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
I closed down my account at the blood bank.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
So you don't think it's a good idea?
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
I go in front first all the time.
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
So I'd like to give it to you.
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
What would be the point in taking the water?
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
I got it! This time, I got it!
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
All right, so we let the girls decide.
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
No, I got a girl in the next building
I just assume not sit next to you.
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
If only I could say things like that around her.
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
Why were you holding the door open for?
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
"Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."
So, you think your parents'll get back together?
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
What kind of person are you going around killing people?
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
All right, get off at the next exit.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
No, no. She put a stop to that.
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.
No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
I don't have it, I threw it out.
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
It might be. I mean whatever you want.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
What, is it for a job or something?
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
well that voice, it's very familiar.. throaty, almost flinty
Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
I drank too much water in the shower.
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
Because I wanted to look good for the party.
So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
Not as many as there used to be.
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
How 'bout if I put a few things --
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
So now he wants her more than ever!
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
So, so what do you want me to do?
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
What did you go up there to heckle her for?
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
When we went to dinner the other night.
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
Well, I think one of us should leave.
No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
You are one sick mama I like it.
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
You know I never got a library card.
I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
They want to know why they never see you.
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
They wont take a cage full of birds.
(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
I was never able to become a banker.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
Well open the door, you get a better look.
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
Well, this has all been one big tease!
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.
Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
I may have to drive that place out of business.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
You mind if I use it in my book?
Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
you gotta relax.. try the yodel (chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
So, what do you think? Does this work?
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
Darren is going away for a long long time.
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
