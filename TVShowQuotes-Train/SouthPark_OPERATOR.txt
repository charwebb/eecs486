You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade them in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.

What is it?!

Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!  All right, boys. Ride's over.

Really?  Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?

Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.

It's gotta go through her mouth

O-kay, five dollars for three balls.

Step on up, just five dollars to play!

Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.

Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.

Okay, we've got a player!

Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?

Uhwhat are you doing?

Five dollars for three balls.

Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.

Taken hostage where?

Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.

Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! 

Shenanigans?

Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?

Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.

Can I help you boys.

Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.  Here you go.  There, you see? We have a winner!

Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.

Keep your hands in at all times.

Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth. 

Sure. It's veery scary.

Please help my out-of-control child.

Sure, as long as they're good.

You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?

Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.

So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS! 

I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic.

Just three tickets, boys.  Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?

Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?

Nine one one, what's your emergency?
