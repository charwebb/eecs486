Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves. 
I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic.
Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?
So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS! 
Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.
Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! 
Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.
You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth. 
Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.
Step on up, just five dollars to play!
Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
Just three tickets, boys.  Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!  All right, boys. Ride's over.
Okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
Really?  Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.  Here you go.  There, you see? We have a winner!
