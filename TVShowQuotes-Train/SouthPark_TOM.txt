Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?

Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning.

'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?

I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.

...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries.

You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!

Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here.

Let me handle this!  I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway!  Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.

In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.

...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart. 

Nine-year-old Wendy Testaburger has started a campaign, and tomorrow will speak before the state senate to ban the use of Photoshopped images, saying they're harmful to young girls.  Young lady, what is your message?

Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference.

Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.

In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called "What What (In My Asshole)".

Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this 

By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact? 

You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!

Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.

Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch? 

At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming!  It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen!  We didn't listen!  All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.

Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.

And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. 

Okay, only a few more bandages to go.

I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town  and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities. 

Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.

Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.  Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives. 

Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?

Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again.

The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.  All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:

Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.

And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.

Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.

Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.

My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?

Yes yes!  Y'all come a-back now, you hear? 

Oh my God, what are we gonna do?

You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want. 

Ah, okay.  Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good. 

Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!

Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it.

In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago.  The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming "The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!" Which is what one would expect someone in the future to yell. 

It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.

Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.

Alright-y then.  Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.

Yes sir.  We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-

...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."  In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini.

Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this .

Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, ssnapped some cartilage...

Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?

Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!

It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park.  When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, "Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp.  Back to you in the studio.

In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated.

Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect. 

Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?

Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!

You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?

I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest ; I'll check on you a little later. 

Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this .

Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!

Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.
