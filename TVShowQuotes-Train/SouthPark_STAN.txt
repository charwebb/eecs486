Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
That was the longest day of school ever!
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
But I don't know any of this stuff.
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
What am I supposed to do about it? 
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
I think we have to signal them somehow.
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
What are you going to do with it, dude?
Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
W-what did you get in a fight about?
So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
That's probably okay if you spread it out.
Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
I don't believe that he's my future self!
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
But, how do they get away with that?
How can they even call that a movie?
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
(I don't think I like this new law.)
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
All right, so how do I join you?
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 
Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
I think he said his name is Marvin.
So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
Well you have to convince them they are real!
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
Come on guys, we might as well go. 
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
And who do we have on our side?
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
No, I don't think either of us can. 
Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
I have to give him half my stuff?
No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
How much is this going to cost us?
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
I think something might be wrong with Dad?
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
We might pass him off as our pet.
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
Right, so how do we get back at them?
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
Dude, is he here every year like this?
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
Well, you might as well let it go.
Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
But you all thought our name was sweet.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
So now we are in th real world.
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
But what do the police do to them?
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
Dude, how long has your future self been around?
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You just did that to everybody in class!
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
You guys, we just wanna know if you-
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
So I can return it to a bank?
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
It might hold the key to a curse.
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
We all have to do this report together, dude.
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 
Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
How are we supposed to give them to you?
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." 
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
When you shoot the puck to another player.
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
We're just going in to get our video game back.
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
Is this for real?? This is for real!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
I know, but you don't tell him that!
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
Could you pull over so I can get out?
Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
My parents will never let me keep a goat
I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
I know we can lose if we try.
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Something I should have done a long time ago. 
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Butters, is there any way out of here?
But I don't understand why we have to--
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
A way to finally do something good for other people.
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
You mean like a baker and a cop?
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
Because I had an itch up my ass.
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
All right, we just need one more person!
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
They said the gas station outside of town.
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
What? How do you know she has a cat? 
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 
We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
He's really got it out for you, dude.
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
Well why did you have to involve me??
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
Dude, do you really have to do it?
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 
We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
Come on, you guys! This is our town!
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
...and then we put them back in the tank.
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
How much do we get if we work for you?
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
So do you know anything that can help him?
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 
Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
And she's at a hotel in our town. 
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
I... said it would really bum them out.
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
I just wanna find something else to play.
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
Do you think they should change the flag?
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
