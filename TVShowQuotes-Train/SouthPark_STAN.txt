What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
And who do we have on our side?
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Something I should have done a long time ago. 
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
Well you have to convince them they are real!
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Dude, how long has your future self been around?
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
How do you guys make them so yummy?
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
A way to finally do something good for other people.
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Is this for real?? This is for real!
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
But what do the police do to them?
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
Butters, is there any way out of here?
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
So I can return it to a bank?
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
No, I don't think either of us can. 
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
You just did that to everybody in class!
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
We're just going in to get our video game back.
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
All right, so how do I join you?
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
But I don't understand why we have to--
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
Well, you might as well let it go.
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
How are we supposed to give them to you?
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
They said the gas station outside of town.
Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
How much do we get if we work for you?
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
I have to give him half my stuff?
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
Could you pull over so I can get out?
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!
Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
What? How do you know she has a cat? 
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 
Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
W-what did you get in a fight about?
You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
How can they even call that a movie?
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Come on, you guys! This is our town!
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
I don't know what the hell that is...
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
But you all thought our name was sweet.
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
I... said it would really bum them out.
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
I know we can lose if we try.
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
What are you going to do with it, dude?
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
I think something might be wrong with Dad?
The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
But, how do they get away with that?
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
What are we supposed to do with it?
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
How much is this going to cost us?
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.
Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.
Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
Come on guys, we might as well go. 
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
(I don't think I like this new law.)
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
We all have to do this report together, dude.
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
That's probably okay if you spread it out.
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
So now we are in th real world.
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 
Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
When you shoot the puck to another player.
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
I know, but you don't tell him that!
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"
...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
Dude, is he here every year like this?
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
...and then we put them back in the tank.
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
Could you just hand us some food please?
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
That was the longest day of school ever!
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
What am I supposed to do about it? 
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
Help me chip some of the ice away.
Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
It might hold the key to a curse.
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
Do you think they should change the flag?
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
Do you think he can ride the bull?
All right, we just need one more person!
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
You guys, we just wanna know if you-
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
He's really got it out for you, dude.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
You mean like a baker and a cop?
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
Because I had an itch up my ass.
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
So do you know anything that can help him?
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
I just wanna find something else to play.
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
Right, so how do we get back at them?
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
What do you think happens if you do have it?
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Dude, do you really have to do it?
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
