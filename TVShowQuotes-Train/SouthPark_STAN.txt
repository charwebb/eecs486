Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
It might hold the key to a curse.
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
I think we have to signal them somehow.
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
How much is this going to cost us?
I don't believe that he's my future self!
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
I have to give him half my stuff?
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
How much do we get if we work for you?
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
A way to finally do something good for other people.
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
No, I don't think either of us can. 
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
What the hell do you want from me?! 
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
And who do we have on our side?
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
I know, but you don't tell him that!
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
What do you think happens if you do have it?
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
How can they even call that a movie?
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
So I can return it to a bank?
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
What am I supposed to do about it? 
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
Come on guys, we might as well go. 
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
But what do the police do to them?
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
I know we can lose if we try.
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
What are we supposed to do with it?
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
I... said it would really bum them out.
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
Dude, do you really have to do it?
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
You mean like a baker and a cop?
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
That's probably okay if you spread it out.
Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
You just did that to everybody in class!
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
I think something might be wrong with Dad?
You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
All right, we just need one more person!
Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
We might pass him off as our pet.
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
We all have to do this report together, dude.
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
But I don't understand why we have to--
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
We're just going in to get our video game back.
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
That was the longest day of school ever!
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 
Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
Dude, how long has your future self been around?
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
Do you think they should change the flag?
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
What are you going to do with it, dude?
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
How do you guys make them so yummy?
Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
I don't know what the hell that is...
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
(I don't think I like this new law.)
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Could you pull over so I can get out?
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
They said the gas station outside of town.
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
When you shoot the puck to another player.
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
But, how do they get away with that?
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
But I don't know any of this stuff.
Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
Right, so how do we get back at them?
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
All right, so how do I join you?
What? How do you know she has a cat? 
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
And she's at a hotel in our town. 
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
Could you just hand us some food please?
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Well, you might as well let it go.
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 
I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
I just wanna find something else to play.
Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
But you all thought our name was sweet.
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 
Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
Help me chip some of the ice away.
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." 
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
He's really got it out for you, dude.
If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
Dude, is he here every year like this?
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Butters, is there any way out of here?
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
Well you have to convince them they are real!
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
So do you know anything that can help him?
Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
Come on, you guys! This is our town!
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
Is this for real?? This is for real!
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
W-what did you get in a fight about?
No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
You guys, we just wanna know if you-
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
Well why did you have to involve me??
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
I took them to see how abortions are done.
So now we are in th real world.
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
Because I had an itch up my ass.
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
