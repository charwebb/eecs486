Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!

That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.

They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 

Hi Grandpa.

You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.

What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.

Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 

Alien?

...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.

Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.

Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.

Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?

Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 

What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!

No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!

Whoa whoa, Cartman.

Screw this, I gotta get back to work!

Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.

What are you gloating about?

Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.

Yeah...

Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?

Yeah?

'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.

No grampa, I'll get in trouble.

Who are the corporations?

Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--

Huh?  Oh yeah.

Good call.

What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!

It was my mom's credit card.

Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.

That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.

That's not cool!

Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.

Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.

Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!

We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!

Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.

Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.

Liver medicine?

So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.

Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?

Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!

It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.

Oh, uh, I'm sick.

Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.

Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.

We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 

Why would Iraqis do that? Why?

Jesus Christ!

Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.

I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?

Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 

Hoohoo what a dumbass!

Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.

Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.

Alright! 

They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.

Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.

Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.

He's right.

Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!

Here it goes.

Aaah!! 

Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.

Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 

Cool!

Who the hell are you?

Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.

You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!

We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 

Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 

Friend. Ahta.

Then you're not a fag.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

Oh God-dammit!

Whoa, dude!

What are we doing here Chef?

Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.

Huh?

What?

All right dude, get in his bed.

Yeah.

He seemed better on TV?

We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. 

... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!

What do we do???

All prepared for liposuction surgery?

Well, sure we can.

Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.

Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.

...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!

I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 

You're a dick!

I found him, I'm rescuing him! 

Jesus Christ!

Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?

Oh, he's fine, dude.

...Ye-eah.

She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 

Yeah, prob'ly

How'd he do that??

Oh, shit!  Oh!

I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.

Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 

Well how sick?

My God!

No.

Hello? 

Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.

Take us out of port! All hands to stations!

Must I?

Can't be

Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.

Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.

We're going upstairs.

I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?

All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,

There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.

All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.

No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.

Hay, you're that band KoRn.

His plan was to use a hammer.

You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!

Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.

Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 

What's the Black Death, Chef?

Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.

We worked our asses off to compete with that?!

I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.

What's this?

No, we have to see Kenny!

...Dad, you are my friend.

It's Saturday.

Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 

Oh no! It's locked!

Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.

Dare.

No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!

Uh what do I have to do?

He just... ignited.

I have?

Ow, that sucks, dude!

Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.

Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 

Oh boy oh boy.

Cartman!

Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.

See? You sound like a dick.

Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.

Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?

...Thank you.

I'll try

No!

Hoh hoh hoh!

They censored the image of Mohammad? How?

Yeah.

Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!

Boy, do I!

Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.

And what does she do?

Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!

Huh?

Should I try them?

We don't wanna hear it.

I know!

All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 

I don't like it. It's spooky.

Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-

Oh, this is giving me a headache.

But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!

Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.

Go on.

What grade are you going into?

We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!

He did it!

Okay, the time has finally come. 

They said the gas station outside of town.

Whoa, dude!

Dude, we just can't tell on them.

We all want double-desserts today!

Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? 

Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!

Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?

You did?

Football.

Aw, crap!

Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.

No, dude, we really, really do.

Irene, you said you loved me!

Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?

Yahtzee.

How can we raise awareness?

Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.

The rock creatures?

Oh, thank God.

Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?

Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.

Yeah, that makes sense.

No, Dad, people will see!

Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?

We showed the shocking footage to the principal!

Huh?

...'K.

Doesn't it give any other directions?

See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.

That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.

Come on, you guys! This is our town!

We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.

Muhammad, are you okay? 

Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.

The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.

What time is it?

Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! 

Ahta? 

Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.

This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?

You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.

No. 

Cartman, you can't do that!

I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.

Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.

Really?

We're not leaving without Chef.

What about him?

But there are no side effects, Chef.

Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.

Yeah! Here's one. 

Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. 

That's it, screw this game!

Who is that?

Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.

Have you reported this to any other authorities?

What are you going to do?

No! 

No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.

We must buy them all! 

"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?

Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.

In Minecraft.

What the hell are you doing here?!

Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.

Can I come in?

You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.

What?!

Screw this! Turn hard to port! 

Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.

What, Butters?

...Kenny? Kenny! 

Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?

Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!

I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 

Can you do it again?

Uh that's okay.

Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.

Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.

You break it down!

Leave me alone grampa. 

We're doing it!

Yeah, I know who you are.

Man, this sucks!

Stop that rat! 

No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?

Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.

Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.

Whooping Fart Balls.

What?

Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!

What's in the box, dude?

From sex??

So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?

We need you to promise not to tell anybody.

Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.

Oh brother.

Yeah!

Well, what can we do about it?

Just do it really fast, and we can go.

Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 

Damn it!

Uuh, yeah.

No, dude, don't! 

Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."

Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.

That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?

Huh?

Sounds good.

Oh, yeah. Eeww.

Huh?

What time is it?!

'Cause, I'll get in trouble.

I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.

Well, I'm glad we took care of that.

Sh!

Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! 

Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!

Oh.

Hey there, little guy.

No not ham!

Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!

Timecist?

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!

I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.

Mom, what are you doing?

Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.

AAAH! 

Really nice work, guys.

Dad? Dad?

Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!

How come you wanna help the fatass?!

'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell? 

Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!

I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.

Dad! What the hell are you doing?!

Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.

Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.

That's Cartman.

O-K, deal.

How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!

Aw Jesus...

Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.

You guys... don't wanna be around me?

Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?

Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.

Well?

Well, at least you got it out of your system.

What? You guys are aliens?

Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 

Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?

Tells?

Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?

Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.

Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.

No, I'm Stan.

The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.

Go ahead, Kyle, do it.

Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 

Yeah, you stupid umbassday!

Suckup.

Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!

Tweek is!

Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?

Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!

'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.

What do you mean?

Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 

Where are they?

Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.

He done killed yer pahr.

We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach

We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 

Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 

Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.

Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.

Thanks.

Hoh!

We travel back in time.

Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.

So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!

The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 

Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!

Let me talk to my dad! 

I dunno. Craig, is that you?

Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.

Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 

That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids

I'm not responsible for what my dad did!

All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.

Hold on, Cartman!

No, dude, I feel worse!

We made it!

Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things

I raced you, You won!

What the hell does that mean?

Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. 

Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!

They did.

The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.

No!

Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?

Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!

Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!

You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.

I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.

Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!

Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...

I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!

Where were you guys going?!

Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?

Again?

Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!

I'll try

How'd you get that on your phone?

Because I had an itch up my ass.

Action!

COME ON LET'S GO! 

Well, what can I do to get back my money-?

Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?

Who are you?

Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.

We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.

Kyle, Kyle! Look. 

Where shall we bring it?

Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?

Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.

Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 

Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!

We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.

They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.

Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!

No!

Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault

Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 

I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.

Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.

You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. 

Come on, nobody's gonna notice.

Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.

Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.

AAAAAAAAH! 

... I'm eight!

Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.

Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!

Dude, I don't know!

Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.

To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.

Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?

I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 

Is that an M&M?

Sick, dude!

Chef.

That's really, really terrible, dude.

Ohmigod, look! 

Hey!  Wait a minute!

Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?

You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?

So I can return it to a bank?

See? Now we can hold out for weeks!

Wait, that's it?

Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.

No problem, dude.

Dude, you are so retarded!

Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.

And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 

Kenny?!  What's he say?

What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!

What??

Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.

Not really.

Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.

Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?

Hey! So what are you going to do now?

Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?

All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!

I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.

Yeah.  War is not my voice.

H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!

It fell;

Uh... Hooray.

No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.

I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.

Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.

If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?

Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.

Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.

God-damnit!

No wait. 

No, that's Kenny.

Hang on.

We wanna talk to Chef.

Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 

What's that?

We might pass him off as our pet.

But it isn't supposed to end like this!

Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.

What about me?

Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 

Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.

What were you talking about?

Dude, we are total rock stars now!

Dad, this is stupid.

Denver? 

Maybe there's another way out of here.

Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.

But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.

That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!

Jesus Christ...

What?

Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.

Dude.

If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?

Stop it! It was me! My idea.

Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.

Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?

Sorry.

Should we tell him the truth?

You know, dude, there might be something to this.

Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.

Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!

Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 

No, no, no, no, we want our money back.

Yeah!

We've got to hide!

You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?

Come on, Tweek! You got him!

It's just...

That's good. 

NO!!

involves needing scissors and glue!

Butters!

Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 

My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.

Dad, Dad, Stop!

What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?

Elton John! What are you doing here?

Bad.

No! You don't need another beer!

No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.

He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.

...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 

Craig, Token, get the slings ready. 

Oh.

Dude, that's not cool.

Hey!

Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?

Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!

Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.

I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.

Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.

I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.

We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!

Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!

Yeah.

Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

Come on, Ninjas! 

Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.

Okay, Manuel, hit it. 

Sh!

Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.

They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!

What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!

What?

Yeah!

No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!

Aww! 

Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.

Go long, Token! Go go! 

N-no?

Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.

Hey, it's happening again. 

Uh huh...

What?!

It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.

Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.

Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--

...K, coming. 

Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.

It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.

...sort of.

Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.

Cartman?

An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.

I do? 

Jesus!

Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 

Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?

I think so.

It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?

Really?

Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.

We've gotta help him, dude.

Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!

Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.

Tango, Tango, I'm in position.

Yeah. Now what are you going to do?

to make it spin.

No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.

Mom, gross! 

What am I supposed to do about it? 

The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.

You know what it is?

Go, go, go.

What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!

You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.

'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.

It's all right, Dad.

No, a double cheeseburger and fries!

Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?

Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.

Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.

Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!

That's gay. 

...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.

Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.

Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!

What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!

Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?

Oh yeah? I can try! 

Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 

Oh boy!

Come on Cartman, fart!

Who's this?

I think something might be wrong with Dad?

We're losing men fast out here! 

We're not gonna make it! 

How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 

Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!

Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.

I don't know! 

They're really that good?

What?? 

What would Jesus do?  Yeheah! 

Right.

Oh, you guys!

Are we making love now?

Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.

Dude, what just happened?

Dude!

Dude! Visitors!

You're talking about Butters.

Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-

Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!

Dude, the road is always snowy.

I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.

"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"

So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.

Well, get away from us then.

We have a question.

This is sooo embarrassing.

It does work!!

Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.

This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!

You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 

Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.

Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!

I'm not friends with him.

Yeah.

Come on, Chef!

I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! 

What the hell?

What?!

Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.

Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 

What kind of help?

Tralala

This is bullcrap, dude!

Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?

The arcade?

Kill the alien?

We don't know. 

Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.

Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.

Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.

Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!

Butters. 

Chef, what's a prostitute?

They what?!

Come on, buddy, let's go! 

I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 

Wait a minute! I've got it. 

Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.

This is the smartest business venture ever. 

What?

Butters, you're the star of the video!

Dude, come back here! 

What?! Why?

Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.

Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!

Damn, dude.

Come on, where are they? 

Wow, poor Kenny.

Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!

Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?

So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.

The bell rang. Can we go?

Quit it.

Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.

Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.

Sally Struthers is saving us!

Cartman!

Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.

Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.

He did it!

Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 

Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?

Dad they aren't here for that.

Yeah.

Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!

Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!

Aw crap, Dad! 

Wall Street?

Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 

Ah, hey, Bebe.

Does this month, November, hold a special significance?

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.

Kyle! 

Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.

I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!

Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?

I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 

I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.

Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 

God damn it God damn it!

Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

Hiya, Sparky.

Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?

We're men.

Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 

Book. Later, dude. 

No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.

I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.

You like... how they smell? How they taste?

What do we do now?

Yeah.

Whatabutt?

Sh. Here they come. 

Guys, you're okay!

I guess... I guess you're right. 

Really?

We don't care.

Oh, cool. A preview. 

All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!

Imagina-he-hey-

Let them pass!  

Aaah! Snake!

Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?

Wait. What's going on here? 

Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--

Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

We got it, Dad.

How expensive?

They deserve it for lying to us, dude.

Hey Kenny! 

Dude, I think I just saw a rat!

What? 

Move out of the way.

This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.

Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 

Yeah, alright.

Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.

The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 

How does someone get herpes?

What?! But you made him into a basketball player.

All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!

Yeah, pretty sure.

My room? Why?

Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!

Dude, these people are insane.

Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.

Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.

What is this place?

Sweet! 

Oh yeah.

What's a Hitler?

Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?

You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!

I.

Huh?

Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!

Kyle! Kyle!

Of course!

Totally gay.

I know, but there's nothing I can do.

What the hell kind of flowers are those?

I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.

I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!

Cartman, tell us.

Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.

That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.

What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?

But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.

...212, 213, 214 members!

Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 

No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.

You do?

Trick or treat.

Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.

Hello, are you Meat Loaf?

Oh, good.

Where are you?

Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!

He's not done for, he's standing right there.

What?? 

We love

Why are you doing this, dude?

No!

U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.

Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?

I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!

Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?

Where's our desks?

What's she doing?

No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!

Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 

But they smell like pee.

It is?

That'd be cool!

Huh? What, uh?

We did it, dude, we did it! 

Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.

Mom, we didn't mean... 

He said I have cynicism?

Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 

What is it, Cartmam? 

You can do it Mr. Mackey.

Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?

No. Dad. Please don't do this!

We want specific networks dropped from our cable.

Sorry.

Ahhhh!  Oh coool!

I, I don't know. He seems all right.

Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 

What's that?

I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.

Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?

What do you mean?

I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.

"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!

What gnomes?

...Yeah.

Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.

Try to find a way past it!

Hey look, Kenny's not dead.

It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

Yeah! How'd you know?

Uh-oh.

We did it!! 

Robert Smith? Sweet!

Aaaah!

I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!

I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!

Juuhachi desu ka? 

Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?

Yeah Dad. You need some of this. 

Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?

Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.

The bus is going over!

What the hell is going on?!

Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.

Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.

Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?

Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!

Uh-eally? Uh you think so?

I've got ADD.

Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. 

We can fix this!

What things??

We... don't... care.

Sshh! Cartman!

What?

You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!

Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.

That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.

You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 

Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?

No, we'll use it.

Oh yeah.

See, I told you dude.

You woke him up! 

Wow. Clubhouses are magical.

The hell do they want? 

After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?

Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!

Sounds like police sirens.

Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..

Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.

All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?

What's the matter with you?

There's fags everywhere!

Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?

No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.

The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.

I'm not done with my pizza.

I just think this whole thing is stupid! 

Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!

Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?

Well what's wrong with it?

Oooh.

I'll try to make it spin.

All right, let's go. 

You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!

What do you mean?

Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.

Tor- torture you?

Bleech!

What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.

How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.

Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'

I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.

Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!

I am ready.

Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 

Yeah. I totally don't get it.

Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.

I'm Raggedy Andy.

You must know what I'm talking about.

Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!

It fell;

Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.

You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-

Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.

Where are you going?

The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-

I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.

Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.

Butters, what happened?

No, my dad doesn't drink.

I'm not voting! 

Like John Elway important?

You don't like doing it?

What the..? 

He's definitely lost it

Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!

Stupid third grader!

I'll be there, you queen!

Fine.

Yeah. Yeah, I get you.

What the hell are you doing, Cartman?

No way! 

What?

Oh yeah, we can't!

Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.

Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?

Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.

Yeah!

It does?

Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!

Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.

Boy, do we!

No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.

Let's head over this way, guys.

Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.

We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.

Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.

Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!

The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 

That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!

Huh?

I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!

Dude, what happened?

Dad?!

Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?

No.

We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?

Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.

Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.

I'm me from the past?

Three million dollars?

I'm not joking.  Do it.

That's not Kyle's...

Then stop being mad!

But what about them?

We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.

Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?

Wow! 

Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.

Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 

But where's Phillip?

Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.

Oh, nice going, Cartman!

Aw spit! 

Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 

It's not gonna work; just come down from there.

But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.

...Bail. 

Just bread...

Yes.

Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?

Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.

But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!

Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?

Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 

Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 

Ogh..!

'Kay, come on guys. 

Oh my God!

What worked?

Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.

Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.

All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.

Divorce is stupid. 

Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 

Dad!

What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.

You like it?

Oh, don't worry about him.

Can't this thing go any faster?

So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 

These guys are pretty good.

We want Sexual Harassment Panda.

Dude! Visitors!

What? 

That sounds pretty fun.

1  2.

Wow, you guys really love animals.

You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 

Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.

That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.

Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.

You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.

Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.

Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.

This is it.

That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.

No, stop! Raape!

I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.

Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.

Huh?

Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.

Aw, come on, Mom.

This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.

Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.

Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!

Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.

Well dude, what are we supposed to do?

Huh? 

Son of a bitch stupid FBI!

Oh my God.

Kickass!

I just wanna do my homework!

We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.

Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.

Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.

W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.

Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!

Yes you can, porky. 

That doesn't sound like shit to you?

Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 

So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 

No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.

Oh, boy! We'll show them!

We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 

Forever.

I don't believe it.

You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!

Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.

Hey, dude, these are good!

'Kay.

Who?

Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 

AAAAAAA! 

But we don't even care about the rainforest.

Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!

He's a really nice kid.

I know you do, Dad.

Cartman?

Where the hell have you guys been?!

Oh.

But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.

Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.

Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?

He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.

Save it, Grandpa!

Um, deny it?

Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 

I didn't think so.

Yeah.

I knew it.

What's Arkansas—is that a state?

Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.

When do we want it?

What are you doing, Gorak!

Oh, whatta? 

We don't want to torture you.

What?!

I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?

...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.

Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 

Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. 

Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 

Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.

Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting! 

Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.

"Or does she?"

Dude, I think it's Saturday now.

There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!

I just want everything to go back to the way it was.

What?

But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.

We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.

Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.

Huff, huff

Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.

What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! 

What? What's he doing?

...Hello?

One please.

Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 

They are trying to save Clyde's mom.

Oh boy.

No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.

We're just going in to get our video game back.

Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.

Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! 

Pff it's like, that's here  and...

Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!

Oh my God, they've killed--

He really wants those dolls.

Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...

All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.

Damn, dude. Look at all these people.

Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.

A boat?

No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.

Bad!

Nothing, just... playing.

Hey guys.

Holy crap, dude.

Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?

You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!

Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!

Dude. That movie sucked.

Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.

Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.

Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 

What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.

Yes!

Kyle, calm down.

Okay, it's clear. Come on! 

Jesus Christ.

Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.

Mr. Garrison?

Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 

Good night grampa.

Huh? 

Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.

Yeah.

Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.

We win again! 

I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?

Wow!

I'm not playing.

Hey Wendy, what's a dildo? 

From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?

He just showed up here.

Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?

Dad? 

Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.

No... NOOO!!

I've had a great teacher.

You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!

You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?

For nothing.

I know.

No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.

I'll try again.

Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 

Butters.

You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.

Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.

Jesus! They're gonna kill her!

Yeah I know.

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

What the hell was that?

Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!

Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 

I always wondered if that would work.

Yes, you can. What's stopping you?

Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?

Excuse me?

You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.

That is our presentation. An idea that we call...

Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.

I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.

Does Mom know about this?

Can we get a different pose, please? 

Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!

Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.

The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.

Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.

What? D-dad, are are you dying?

Awww! 

Why do you wanta know, lady?!

Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.

Oogh.

Come on you guys, let's go home. 

How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!

Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?

That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!

We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 

Hey look, there's something here.

Yeah.

You suck now, Kyle! 

Yeah, they do, Kyle.

You mean, Cartman's side is right?

Get to the stage! 

The hell's going on now?!

Yeah, we did. 

I'll get it. 

Where is our Okama GameSphere?

Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 

Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.

Where's Chef?

Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.

We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!

Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 

Christmas?

Whoa! 

Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.

It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!

How are we supposed to give them to you?

Yeah dude. It's really serious.

He said I can stay.

Alright, Dad, I'll add you!

What?

Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!

I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.

What's the matter with him.

Fine, douche! 

Just, just a little.

Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.

Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?

It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.

No! This is stupid!

Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.

Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 

Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.

HaaAAAA! 

Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?

Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?

Me. I'm asking the question.

Come on, dude!

Man, this sucks.

Sick, shut up dude. 

I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.

Dude! 

Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!

Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!

Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!

This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 

Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!

There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!

Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.

What's Casa Bonita?

Yeah.

That's because I was pissed off!

I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?

Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!

No, you don't!  Dude!

Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?

Why?

Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!
... totally.

All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.

Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.

Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.

Don't hurt it! 

If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?

You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 

Dad, are you all right?

No, never.

What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.

Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.

He's fakin'!

Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.

Uh huh.

Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?

They're here! Hurry and hide! 

What'cha do to Butters this time?

It fell;

Killer! Thanks, Chef.

Governor's office?

You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 

No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!

No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Really? That'd be sweet.

And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.

Or else what?

We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.

Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.

O-okay.

Uh, crap..!

I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.

There she is! 

We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.

What?!

He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.

Thank you.  Mr. Hankey. 

Sleds are for guys.

Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.

Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.

Let's go. 

Huh?

And there's no score? No crowds?

Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.

Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.

Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?

Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?

Well are you gonna tell your dad?

God damnit, that fat piece of shit!

The American Association of Retired Persons.

Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!

You-you're all joking, right?

But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?

No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.

Please, ih ih, it won't take long.

Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.

We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?

Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.

Awww what?!

Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?

But I didn't write the note!

See ya, Dad!

Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.

We don't know anything about animation.

Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.

Cool!

Hey look!

My mom won't let us. 

Oh no!

Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!

Dude, what the hell is going in?!

This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.

How many days left in summer?

Why?

Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.

Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.

Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!

"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.

You're leaving already?

I think his name is Junjun.

Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.

...Coats?

I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.

Almost.

Hey, there's some people. 

We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!

All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!

No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.

Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?

Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?

Tell us what?!

...Okay. I'll vote.

Oh, dude! 

Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?

We can stay. And fight.

What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.

Dad, do we really have to wear bras?

What's the scariest thing we could get?

Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!

Dad, don't get carried away.

Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?

Dude, what the hell?

Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!

Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.

Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.

Cartman, come on!

Why?

I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.

Tolerance camp?

Pry his mouth open!

I am?? I didn't know that!

Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!

Dude, let's play Fireman.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Can you tell us where "that" is, please?

Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.

Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?

Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!

I'm in.

And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,

I'll live with you.

I feel... different.

I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.

Fine, Mom.

Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?

He's looking at the sign.

No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!

Well, where is he?!

Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.

We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!

What?

Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.

Deal, druggie!

Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.

Huh? What? Have they come for us?

Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.

Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-

Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- 

Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? 

Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 

Hey dude.

Craig, dude, wait up.

Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?

What are you going to do with it, dude?

They're in London too?

You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?

I'm just a-scared of snakes.

I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.

Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!

No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! 

Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??

Do you remember what pet store?

Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!

Yahtzee. 

Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!

I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.

Get the fuck out of here. 

But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.

Is this the right house?

This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.

All right, fine, go ahead.

I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 

Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?

Dude, I don't even know who that is.

AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 

Yeah, us too.

The police?

Jesus?

Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!

Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.

Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.

Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.

Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 

I like the PS4's controller better.

I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 

Yes. No foolies.

What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!

No.

Isn't that your job?

You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"

What do you mean?

Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.

That's so gross.

Bad.

Somebody in this class?

No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.

Where are we supposed to go?

Yeah it's different, Mom!

They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 

Come on! Come on! 

Oh my God! Dr. Adams!

Hey, can I join in? 

Let's get out of here!

What? Who-who is this?

Oh. Uh-I don't know.

We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.

This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 

I don't believe it.

Hey, where did you guys go?

I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.

Where's the going-away party?

Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.

You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!

Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.

Oh my God, they revived Gorak.

...Why?

Dude, this isn't working.

Go Wing! 

We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.

Hey Chef.

Where are you going, Kyle?

I, I can't, I can't believe it.

Are you serious??

Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.

But what do the police do to them?

Oh God!

Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.

Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!

Yeah, this line is way too long!

Dad, you're a geologist!

Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?

Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 

No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!

Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. 

I like it. 

...Craig's show??

Why don't we just tell our parents?

There, how does that look?

No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.

But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.

This is um, Thad Jarvis.

So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song

Nice going, fat boy!

Damnit! 

We're sinking.

No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??

I don't think we're in a very safe spot.

Okay, where to next?

...Free? 

Dude, who the hell are you?

Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.

That's not disciprine.

to make it spin.

Come on Cartman, fart!

You're dead, Mr. Jackson!

Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.

I'll try again.

Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?

Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.

Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?

Yeah.

I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.

...Hey, you can't do that!

What's mean about it?

Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.

That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.

Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 

Yeah?

Detective McCormick found something interesting. 

Then damnit man, do it!

So you'll do it?

Nno, that's stupid too. 

Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 

What's going on?

It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.

Aw come on, Kyle.

Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 

Yeah. It's cool, holmes.

We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.

I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.

We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.

Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 

Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.

What?

Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?

Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!

They're shooting at us.

Dude, stop it.

Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?

Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?

Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!

Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"

Oooh?

Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 

Hit something nice and solid now. 

Bleech!

Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 

For giving Howard Stern a hummer!

Well this time he's gone too far!

Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.

Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?

I do not!

No, no, it's not.

Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.

I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.

Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 

Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.

What?

Awww..!

Yeah?

I kept it secret, for two days!

Dude, he's still not dead.

Huh?

We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?

Are you the head of Homeless Studies?

I don't know.

Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.

Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.

There he is!

This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.

It's okay, Mom. I understand.

I'm not shooting anybody.

Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 

You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"

I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. 

Cremated? What's that?

...Yeah?

...What?!

He's right.

We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.

Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?

Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!

Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!

Look, Kyle. Look. 

Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.

We thought you were in jail.

Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.

I don't care, just hurry! 

What?

Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?

Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?

I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.

Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?

Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?

What the hell is he talking about?

Uh oh.

Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.

Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!

God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 

Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!

Wow! Count me in!

But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.

Dude!

Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!

What?

Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.

Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.

Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 

I don't get it.

What's a dildo, Kenny?

No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.

Come on, let's go. 

Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?

You guys, we're gonna lose our client. 

So?

Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.

Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.

Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?

Oh, Red Lobster.

No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?

Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?

You guys, school starts in ten minutes!

Don't put this all on me, Kyle!

Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.

If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.

Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.

Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.

"Awgh! I'm so fat!"

Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.

I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.

No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 

Well, drop them in! 

Go to hell, Cartman!

Wait, what is that?  Dude!

...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!

Goddammit, dude, I don't know.

What are you guys doing out here?

Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 

Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?

Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 

No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.

There has to be a way!

Okay.

Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?

Again?

I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.

...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.

Yep. Tomorrow night.

We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.

All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!

Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.

Grandpa?

Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.

Woof.

Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!

Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.

Come on, Cartman, get on.

No way, dude! Don't be silly.

Alright, now it's time for phase 2.

Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 

And it was like WHAM. 

On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.

...What?

Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 

Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! 

Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.

Damn.

My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.

Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 

Really?  Thank you.

HA, I blew your head off!

...I have no idea.

Dad, Death is coming!

Dude, Butters, calm down.

Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.

Aww, Goddammit!

Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.

Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.

Hi Shelly.

Yeah, I get it for that.

I thought I was supposed to!

Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.

Huh.

Not... all the time.

No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.

Wha-a-a negroplasty??

Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!

Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!

That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.

I guess, but-- 

I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!

Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!

That was the longest day of school ever!

We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!

Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!

Aghh!

And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.

'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 

Uh...

It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 

Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.

I think he said his name is Marvin.

Here! 

I've been getting my best friend back.

What, dude?

I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.

You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.

Shut up, Cartman!

Goddamnit. 

Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!

Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"

Aaaah!! 

We're on like, some foreign planet.

Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.

Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.

Okay it says I'm at your farm.

I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."

"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."

Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.

Mr. Garrison threw away his car?

Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.

Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?

Hey, yeah! 

Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.

Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 

I dunno.

Dad, I was just a--

My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 

Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.

Dad? What the hell is going on?

There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.

They took yer jarb!!

But crackers are his- body.

A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.

Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.

I don't want to shoot the bunny.

Hey. 

No, we have to return it! 

Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. 

Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.

Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-

Did I what?

I can't see. 

Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 

'Scuse me.

Hello?

Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.

Aw, shit.

Hey, how about this little guy?

Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.

But why do I have to leave?

Aww! Not those guys again! 

Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?

Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?

No, dude!

This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.

You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 

No, he's annoying.

What happened then? 

Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?

Nooo!

They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.

It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.

Uh-oh.

Dude, I have to!

That's it?

No, that's okay. 

It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.

What?!

You're an asshole, Kyle!

Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?

She has to be here! 

No Santa, don't!

Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!

Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.

Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.

Run for your life, dude! 

... Really?

"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"

But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!

I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?

NO!

This doesn't look very safe.

So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.

What, come on, it's not that bad.

But why?

Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.

Profile? I'm not a profile.

Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!

I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.

Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--

Maybe they couldn't get out!

Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 

No you don't, fatass!

Okay, let's try this. 

Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.

More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!

Come on dude, it's pretty funny.

I think Verizon.

Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!

Dude, where is she? We can't wait.

We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!

Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 

Well no, don't throw that out.

...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.

Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 

What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?

They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!

Oh my God.

Kyle!

Are you ready grampa?

Do you have our Okama GameSphere?

What is this place?

Hey, what's goin' on?

All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.

Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.

Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-

Cartman, no! 

We... don't work for any-body.

Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.

There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.

Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?

Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.

It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.

And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.

Come on! We're going to his house! 

Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!

Dude, it's our dads.

No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!

My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.

Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?

You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 

...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?

I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?

I wanna return this Margaritaville.

Hey Dad.

'bout what?

Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!

Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!

All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.

...What the fuck?!

Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.

Kyle!

I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!

Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?

...I don't know.  I like it.

Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 

Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!

What do ya mean?

Our friend, Chef.

Wow! Good job, dude!

What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.

Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 

Come on, we'd better hurry. 

Oh, brother! 

They can't say "shit" on television!

Too late?! The hell is that?!

What are you guys doing?

I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.

Basketball?

Winter's back!

Really?

What's the matter?

That's your dad?

I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.

I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!

Exactly! People don't even know where it is.

Aarrgghh!! 

Oh my God, how does it know the answer?

This can't get any worse. 

Chef, we need more food.

Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.

Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.

We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.

Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?

So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?

How?

Grandpa's in it too?

It's a lousy business. I quit.

But then, why does God give us anything to start with?

YES.

This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.

Dude! We've been waiting forever!

So wait, did we do good?

Tomorrow?

Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!

Tell me about it.

What?

Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 

What's going on?

It's boring.

Uh oh, mall cops.

Yeah.

Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?

Good luck with your company, dude.

So how do we do that?

Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 

What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.

But you didn't die?

Butters is totally fine with it, dude.

No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!

You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 

People from the future. Right, got it.

You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?

I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?

Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 

We all have to do this report together, dude.

...O-kay.

'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.

Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.

Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?

Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.

Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-

Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.

Bluuch. 

No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?

What do I say??

Wendy! 

It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.

Well... Maybe they'll change.

What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!

What? How do you know?

Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?

Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?

Plastic pumpkin pails...

I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!

This is Nebraska?

Kyle? What's happening?

What?

Wait. Where's my Dad?

Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?

Oh no, no, NO.

Why?

No, uhno, not finkleroy.

Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?

Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!

All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?

I take it back!

Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.

Oh ooh.

So why can't he live here now?

Jesus Christ!

We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!

Huh oh. 

Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!

You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 

Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.

Yeah.

What??

We're metrosexual!!

Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?

Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?

You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.

We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.

Me?

No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 

All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!

Get us down from here!

Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 

What's that?

Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?

Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.

Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.

Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!

Ow!

A big mutant version of me?

Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!

I'm sure they'll be here any minute.

This isn't working.

No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.

The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.

Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.

Jesus, Jesus!

Why do you keep saying "hella," fatass?!

A what?

...No.

Base! 

Wait, woodland critters... 

Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.

You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 

This land is not for sale.

The what?

Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.

What?

Where??

Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.

Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."

Dad!

I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.

Uh, Chef.

It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.

Wow!

Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!

Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.

Chef, you have to dump the bitch!

Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!

Did you get to any dirty parts yet?

Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 

No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!

Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!

Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.

My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?

Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 

Oh Jesus Christ! 

A note?

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 

What?

What, Cartman? What's happened?

Whoa, cool!

...What?

How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?

Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 

Wow, is that from Origins?

It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.

And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.

Did so!

Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 

Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!

That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.

No, he didn't.

Cartman, stop it!

How should we split up?

They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?

The House of Greyhawk?

But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.

Wow, cool!

Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 

What the hell are they doing now?

Yeah, where's all the fighting?

Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"

Ow!

It fell;

No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.

All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 

Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.

Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!

Wha? 

Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!

No way.

Holy fucking shit!

Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?

We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.

Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.

I know we can lose if we try.

Who are you?

No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-

Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.

I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 

So?

Why not?

I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.

Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!

Okay, it's all clear. 

Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?

It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 

No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 

The hell are you doing, dad?

Nobody has any ideas?

God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.

E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.

Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.

Dude, bail! 

Yeah, I have to remember that.

I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.

What is that?

Dad.  Good luck.

Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.

Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 

Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.

All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.

AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!

Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!

...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?

But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 

What the hell was that?

Yeah, that'd be funny.

Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 

No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 

I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.

No, Dad, NO.

Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.

Uh, Wendy?

No.

One-two-three, not it!

All right!

You look a lot better.

It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!

And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.

Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?

Holy shi-  poop.

What, dude?

Oh, son of a bitch!

I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.

Yeah!

When you shoot the puck to another player.

Okay, this is everything, mom. 

Yeah! Go away, Pip!

Yeah, dude. It's right over there.

Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 

Whoa, dude! 

Help!

Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?

I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.

This is boring.

Get a hold of yourself, man!

When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!

Kyle, NO! 

Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 

Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 

Dude, what's your little brother doing here?

Put it out, put it out! 

Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?

Sure, Wendy, whatever.

Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?

I don't believe that he's my future self!

You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?

Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.

Please what?

Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.

I'm getting on it first.

Have I missed anything?

Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?

Pretty good.

Yeah!

Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.

Oh, my God! They've killed--

Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!

This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 

Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.

No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.

Yuh.

Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!

Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.

What are you talking about?

God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!

Dude! W-what are you doing?

I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!

Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.

He's been up there for like, three weeks.

Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.

Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-

Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.

Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.

I don't think they sell those anymore. 

You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!

Ughh.

Huh?

Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??

Our case?

'Scuse me, my name is-

What?!

Guys, come on! 

Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Cartman!

To Los Angeles?

Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!

I won't say a word.

We're here.

Cartman!

Yup.

Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.

Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.

No, dude, we never even saw it!

Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.

Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 

You can't be serious! You people like this?!

Dad, oh my God!

Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.

You did? 

...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.

Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.

Adam Sandler's funny.

When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!

Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-

So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?

Gay.

Hoh, whatever! 

'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!

Islam??

He's the record.

You guys, we just wanna know if you-

Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?

Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.

Yeah.

Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 

Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!

Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.

Huh? Why?

Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?

You can say that again.

Oh! Here she comes.

Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.

Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.

Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.

Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.

But Wendy, we don't understand how that-

WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!

Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?

Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.

Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.

This is it??

Hey Tweek.

We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.

Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?

CHEF!

Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!

Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?

What the...&#160;?

Mr. Hankey? 

What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?

Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?

God dammit!

Sacrificed? For what?

I thought you guys were sick! 

What are they talking about?

God dammit!

You know, "they."

'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.

Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?

Fox trot standing by at position alpha.

We, just came to ask a question.

Tralalalala

Oh, hey Kenny.

Dude! Fuck your crops! 

Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 

Oh boy.

Timmy, you have to stop!

They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.

Really?

All right.

You're just saying that, Cartman.

Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!

Come on, let's do this!

I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.

Dolphins are way smarter than you!

Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.

That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.

I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.

Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 

No, I seriously don't want any more friends.

Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 

Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 

Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.

Okay, here we go. 

No, that's way too long!

You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?

...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.

Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!

Oh, now she figures it out.

Dude, you totally lied to me!

We committed him.

Chef, we're in a repeat.

That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball

We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.

U-uh, Chef.

Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!

Dad?

Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 

She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!

Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 

I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.

But isn't he only three years old?

No, dude, that doesn't make sense!

Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!

Chef, we did something kind of bad.

Hey, he's coming towards us.

Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage! 

Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!

I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.

Yeah.

Sshhh!

Wait, wha-what?

Whoa!

Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!

Wow. How did that happen?

That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!

Goddamnit... 

Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

I know.

Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.

...Wait, what were we doing again?

Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!

Right. Uh, see ya.

Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!

Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 

Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!

How's it goin', fat ass?

Crab people?

Good. How are you?

All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 

What is that?

Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?

He told my dad he was...

Hello?

Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?

Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 

I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

We made it! 

Wa-was it wearing clothes?

Who?

Crap.

Dude! How did you do that, Butters?

Come on, we gotta go check on him. 

...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-

Oh wow...

Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?

Okay, turn on the ignition,

You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.

Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!

No.

He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.

Help you how?

What?

No!

Okay! 

Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?

Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus

We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!

Yeah.

Ah, shit.

Nah.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.

Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.

Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.

Did Kyle know about this?

Oh Jesus, can we just practice?

Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 

We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.

For what?

Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!

Okay, it's clear. 

Then what are we going to do.

...What?

Dude, not cool. This is scary. 

Where to now, Chef?

Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.

Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?

Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.

You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 

My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!

Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!

Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?

But MOM!

Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!

Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 

We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?

Alright, let's go.

Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?

Good-bye, Robert Smith!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Dad, weren't you watching?

No, you can't even show his feet.

Presents.

Did the Devil show up yet?

McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?

What are you doing here?

Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?

We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!

I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.

Where are we?

It's supposed to be a frog!

Stop, you fucking lunatic! 

Why?

Yeah, it's kinda weird.

Ugh. Damint.

I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.

Did you come here to help me?

Well, we tried, dude.

I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 

So Bono's newest record is a lie!

Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.

Leave me alone!!

We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.

Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!

Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.

Go, go, ruuun! 

No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt

Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?

A six-layer burrito?

No, we're friends.

Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!

It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.

Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!

Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.

Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.

Then that's where I belong.

I saw it this way!

I'll try

Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.

Got what all figured out?

Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?

Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.

You do?

It is not!

Hey, can they do that??

Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.

Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 

You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.

Yeah, I wanna know already.

No way!

Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 

Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.

Naturally.

It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 

Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.

Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?

I'll pay you back for it, okay?!

Yeah!

That'd be awesome!

That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!

Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.

Hey yeah! 

You dumbass, Cartman!

Oh Jesus. 

So unfair... so unfair.

I didn't even think about that.

Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.

Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 

Sweet!

Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.

Yeah. What's a discharge?

Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.

Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!

Wait a minute. Cartman?! 

Hey future self.

Huh, excuse me?

You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.

Hey Chef. Look.

No!

Sound pretty typical to me.

L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.

Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 

I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!

I don't know you!

Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 

Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!

Bleech! 

Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?

I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 

Come on, angry mob! 

...Like ...money? What?

Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?

And we're... cut! &gt;&gt; /&gt;/&gt;

Oh.  Aaah! Snake!

Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?

Jesus, dude! 

Whoa, dude! 

Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.

Come on, Butters. Time to go.

He can't hold it in forever.

Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!

Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.

Hello? Hello, anybody here? 

...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.

What??

Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.

'Kay.

Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.

We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.

Kenny?

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!

Dude, bail! Bail! 

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

It's a mirror.

"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez." 

Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?

Dad, what are you doing?

Why does that matter?

Thanks Kyle.

What is he saying?

Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!

Shut up, Pip.

Sweet! 

What titties?

Dude, the hell just happen?

Wow!

Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!

Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!

No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!

Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.

Let's get out of here! 

What, Pip?

Ugh, Jesus Christ! 

Ohhh, fuck it!

Let's just do this, all right? 

Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!

And who do we have on our side?

You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!

That's us. Come on.

Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?

Because my dad's an idiot!

Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.

Dad, where's our Bible?

You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.

Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.

Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.

Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.

Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.

Great! 

Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!

Oooh.

Dude, this isn't right.

Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.

It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 

There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.

You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!

But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?

OK, whenever you're ready.

Dude, don't you remember where it is?

I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.

It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.

Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!

What the hell is going on? 

All right, let's get the hell out of here! 

But are you back for good?

Butters. Dude!

Ahhh, bicycles?

Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 

Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!

Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?

All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I

Go on, dude it's the only way.

Now, Cartman! 

Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!

It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.

He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.

Dude. Sh-she's right.

Aaaaaagh!

Ohhh.

After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 

Dude, what did you make that doll out of?

But dude-

Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!

I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.

I can't, I just can't.

Now's our chance!

They're after you! 

That self-promoting asshole!

"We wish you a m- Merry"

Right. 

Oh.

Yeah, no, this is great.

Oh, thank God.

Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 

We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.

My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.

Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?

Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?

Why does he keep saying that?

...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!

Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 

Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger

Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...

Sso then we win?

That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.

Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.

You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.

Hey guys.

Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?

Wow, the Moses.

Dude, that seems kind of... weird.

Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...

A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!

Kenny, you home? 

...You sound like Cartmam.

Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.

Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.

Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.

Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.

Oh boy.  Bleech! 

Oh my God, she killed Kenny!

Hey! We've landed in ice cream!

They aren't leaving.

Awesu-home!

To destroy the Evil Power!

Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?

Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-

We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.

And a chef hat.

So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 

That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.

Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.

Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.

I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.

Pass it to me, Cartman?

Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!

All right, so you're sure he can dance?

Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 

Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! 

No. I didn't, but-

What?!

Dude, weak!

I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!

Because we're on Ritalin.

Cartman, you stupid asshole! 

In the backyard?

What?

No, we don't wanna do anything.

Do you see the sea people.

Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.

You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?

Come on, dude, it's not that hard!

Wait wait, where the hell are we now?

Two hundred? Million?

Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.

Aw Jesus, not again.

You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!

Huh?

But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.

Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.

What?

Damn.

Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?

Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!

Stem cells?

Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 

Damnit!

Morning!

Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.

Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?

(I don't think I like this new law.)

How do you feel?

Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!

Dude, it is called History Channel.

Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

He's not gonna do it.

We can't let him down, you guys.

Pizza... pizza... pizza...

Dude, how'd you do that?

Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!

Whoa, Christmas snow!

Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.

I can't afford a cruise, dude.

Okay, what have you got?

Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.

Did you hear anything more about what happened?

The principal? Aw, come on!

What?! 

Oh shit, did we do that?

Now do you people believe me?

Why is that funny?

Get back inside! 

Yes it is!

What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!

No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 

Yeah.

Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.

Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.

You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!

That is our understanding.

Is something wrong, Wendy? 

...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!

Dude!

All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 

If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.

What?!

It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 

Oh my God!

But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.

Dad, why did they do that?

"Scream for me, bitch!"

Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.

Aw, what do we do, Chef?!

Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.

Fine.

Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 

No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!

Yes, it is.

It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!

I know, a-and look. 

You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 

I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.

I don't know. 

Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.

No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 

Huh?

Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.

No problem.

Thanks, dude.

Uh, thanks.

Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.

Sounds like shit.

Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!

Dude, what are you guys doing?

Celery?

How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?

But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?

Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?

He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-

Oh, dude, let's go!

Oh Jesus!

You tell 'em, Cartman!

Christmas Poo?

...conformist.

Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.

Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.

Let's go see a movie! 

I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.

My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 

Hike!

Then let's go, dude! 

What was that?

Something I should have done a long time ago. 

Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.

But the girls like singing and dancing.

Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 

Man, this condom's driving me crazy.

What's 'skylarkings'?

It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 

Get over here and untie us! 

Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.

I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 

Wait! Where are you going?

So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?

They want his power?

Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.

Good luck, Bulrog. 

I'm nine years old.

Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?

That does it! Attack! 

Wow, he died.

Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.

...Huh??

Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?

We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!

Nobody's paying any attention. 

Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!

Up yours, evil twin! 

Hey, what's this? 

Wow, that's amazing.

Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.

Dad Dad, we have a problem.

Hey, look, Craig just walked in. 

I can't do it, dude.

It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 

But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.

Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!

(Okay, okay, just go away!) 

Dare. 

Let's go!

I know where.

What does that mean?

Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.

All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.

Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.

We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?

You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.

Stan.

AAH. 

Ddue, we have to try.

They've all been lying to us this whole time!

Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?

That does it! I'm calling the police! 

Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.

Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.

Butters? 

He doesn't have to do homework?

Did you get it? 

What?

But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.

How can you say that looks good?!

What's a - homosexual?

Do something, Kyle! 

It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 

You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!

Hi. Can Token come out and play?

Mom, will you get Dad out of here?

What?

You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.

Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.

Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.

What the hell is that? 

Yeah, maybe you're right. 

We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!

We have come to return the weapons we purchased.

Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?

What a bitch!

Excuse me.

And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?

Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.

Yeah.

Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!

Dude, I don't get it.

Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!

Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!

What?

Butters, come out here.

Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-

Who's Joseph Smith? 

That was awesome!

I bet I get more candy than you dude.

The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 

Yes…

Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.

Okay. 

Kyle! Kyle!

Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.

Come on, Dad!

I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!

Hey, Chef.

Hey, Bill Cosby.

Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!

Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 

We're working on it.

Who's Karen Carpenter?

So how did I do?

Dude, what the-&#160;? 

Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?

...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.

What?

I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--

No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?

Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.

Yeah!

We have to find a way out! 

Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. 

Smug?

No!

Good!

Jesus Christ.

Aliens?

Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?

Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.

Mr. Garrison, stop!

Butters, go on!

Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.

Booooo!

Kyle! You have to stop them!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

There's nothin' to do.

No! 

Oh, hey Cartman.

Where's our Bible?

Dude, that's my dad!

Chef!!

But her note said she'd be here. 

I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.

Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!

Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!

Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?

We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.

He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.

Why?

Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??

Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.

We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.

Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?

Dad!

Well, so much for our money.

Towelie!

It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!

Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 

What do I have to do?

You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.

All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.

Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.

Underpants?

Cool. 

What's awesome?

Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.

Oh my God, what's going on?

We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.

Dude, you okay? 

Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.

But, how do they get away with that?

I got it! 

Okay, go. 

No, I mean, kill my grampa.

You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?

Oh no...

But what if we want to give somebody herpes?

Where's you get the balls from?

All right Butters!

Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?

What?

Teacher, our egg is... okay. 

Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.

I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?

Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 

Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 

Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?

Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.

Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!

Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.

So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?

Wendy!

Yeah! 

Yeah.  Where are you guys going?

Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.

We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.

It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.

We won, dude!

My Internet's not working either.

You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?

No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 

Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!

Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.

What was that?

I bet I scored 100!

But why? Why would you quit?

Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 

Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...

...Well then why aren't we waking up?

No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.

Me??

Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?!

Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?

Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!

Don't kill Kenny!

Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.

Yeah, it was huge.

The lion cubs!

No.

...Christmas is about something much more important!

You've had five, dude!

Oh God!

He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.

Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.

You don't come to this country and make fun of it!

Nooo-ho! 

No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!

Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!

Alright, here. 

That looks AWEsome! 

Yeah...

Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.

Haha! You lose, fatass!

What was his point?

"Fuck you" what?

Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?

Because it's really, really funny.

If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.

Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.

Cartman's?

I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 

No you didn't!

Alright! 

Noo problem!

Hang on, Santa! 

Gay people?

Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.

Here they come!

Hey Gary.

Jesus Christ!

See?

Hoh! 

Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.

Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.

Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!

Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.

That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.

Dude, he's got Heather!

A way to finally do something good for other people.

What the hell are we gonna do??

What about him?

Oh man, I feel like a total choad.

No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!

I just wanna find something else to play.

Dude, this is awesome.

I don't know.

You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?

But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.

He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.

Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.

You guys. You guys, wake up! 

Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-

Oh fuck you!

Hey, that's what I wrote about!

Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.

Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?

Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!

Aw, dammit!

He's taking swimming lessons.

You would think that, you little ass-sucker.

But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.

Aww!

Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?

Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!

Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.

Who was that?

SWEET!

Uh, what?

Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.

I don't know.

They're coming!

How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?

Are they playing basketball? 

Dude, how long has your future self been around?

They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.

The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.

Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 

Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!

That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?

Come on, guys. 

Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.

Dude, we don't care.

Apples?

Hey Kyle.

'K, let's put him on here. 

Whoa, dude!

You mean,you're a ginger?

Oooh.

There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!

Hey that's right. We need a ringer. 

Aargh! 

Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.

Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.

No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!

Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.

Ah, Canada?

Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!

Confession? 

Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.

Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.

Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?

You alright dude?

...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.

Wow, cool.

I don't know. Let's go see. 

Wow.

I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.

Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 

I dunno.

Yeah, like ancient history.

You are now.

Quick, jump through the window.

And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.

Nothing

Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?

Oh, Jesus.

Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?

I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."

Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.

I think I have extra.

Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?

Aaawww.

Shut up Cartman!

Let's see what's in there.

Yup.

Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 

Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!

You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 

Aw, crap.

Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.

I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!

Let's go, Park! Come on!

Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.

Choirs suck.

Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.

69ingchipmunks@me.com 

Woohoo!

So then we can't sue him?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.

Cartman's a girl now?

We can't let our party suck.

We can't do this without you now! Come on! 

God damnit!

This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!

No, my parents are.

Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?

Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?

You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!

Like what?

You mean the old Galveston Lodge? 

What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!

What are you talking about, Cartman?!

Kyle? Kyle, what happened?

Parents?

No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!

I know. He's here.

All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.

We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.

Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.

Well?

Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.

Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.

I saw him once. 

Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.

Red rocket, red rocket!

Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.

Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Son of a bitch!

Jesus, dude!

I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!

Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.

Shut up!

But mom, my teacher will-

Yes, Grandpa.

These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!

Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.

Wow. 

He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.

That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!

All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 

Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.

How much do we get if we work for you?

Go on, Butters!

You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!

That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.

No. I broke the dam.

What?

What?! 

Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.

I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.

Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.

You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.

Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.

What's going on? Are we in trouble?

What?

Don't care. 

Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.

How?

What the hell?

Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.

Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 

You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!

Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.

Really??

Yeah.

Stop right there, you little rat!

Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!

Well, ah, I mean...

Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.

Please, take us to them! Please!

Hey look! There's a taxi! 

Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.

That's not in the script  They do this all the time.

Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.

Damnit! And we thought we were so original!

Yeah, dude, that's gross.

Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.

What's meecrob?

Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.

Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!

Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.

Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!

Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.

There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!

Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!

Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!

Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!

Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 

What's your ninja name, Kenny?

Play the Red Wings?

Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.

What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.

But I don't think it's working.

I guess we'll just take all of 'em.

Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 

Where's Kenny??

Butters?

Uh, Butters, could we have it?

Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??

That was a good one.

Phillip? That's not Phillip.

JUST RUN!! 

Cartman, you have to stop!

Shut up, Butters!

You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.

Do you see 'er dude?

Man, the bus sure is late.

I just turned 10.

We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.

There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.

Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!

Boy, this is the life, huh guys?

This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!

Yeah!

Oh-hoho!

Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?

You got 'em, Marvin.

Jesus dude! 

Uh... I'm eight?

Dude, I really don't care. 

No, I'm done with that! 

Dad, where's the phone book?

Who is that? 

It's dead.

Huh?

Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.

...Go away.

She looks pretty hot here.

Yeah, that one!

They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.

Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.

It will have to do. We're not getting closer.

My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.

Yeah.

Mom...  Dad, it was just a-

A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?

We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!

Right now, goddamnit!

Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.

Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.

Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!

Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 

...What?

Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?

Oops.

Our... scause?

What the hell?

We don't?

I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.

Oh, hell!

No! We won't let you destroy our town!

I took them to see how abortions are done.

Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?

Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?

But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.

Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?

That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.

What?? 

So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?

Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.

I know.

Uhhh, sh-sure?

Okay, good.

Yeess, this stuff rocks!

Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.

How do you know?

What the hell was that?

Uuh, you'll see.

Well, what does it say?

You know, freshen up your breath.

I'll try

Boo!

Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.

Get near the puck! 

* I told you, fatass.

I know! This is awesome!

It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.

Ugh.

Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?

No, he didn't!

Cartman, where are you going?? 

You should apologize to Kenny too.

Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 

...Stan.

At least I'm not a little pigfucker!

Dude, the commercials could start any time!

You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 

A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.

Now, that's a get-well card! 

forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!

Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?

Weak!

No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.

15 agility.

Ho-o-oh.

But you all thought our name was sweet.

Tie? Well, what does that mean?

Stay clear, guys, stay clear.

I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.

Hooray! 

That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?

Yeah dude, you can test them.

It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.

Butters, don't be such a pussy.

Okay, go ahead and start.

Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?

He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."

Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?

Yeah, mine too.

Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.

God!

Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

What the hell do you want from me?! 

Get all the stuff! 

I gotta get home for dinner.

Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.

It fell;

Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 

How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.

...I think I have a better idea.

Come on, Butters.

Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!

What?

Yeah, but why?

No, you just lost it all!

Sure.

See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."

The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!

He can't hold it in forever.

Okay. We're done.

Dad? Not now!

Jesus Christ! 

You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.

You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!

You really think so?

Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?

Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!

Whoa duude!

Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 

Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.

Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.

Oh gosh, killed Kenny!

Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 

Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! 

Come on! 

Oh no, dude.

Dude, we got GameSphere.

...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 

Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!

I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.

We sit.

No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.

Oh hey, there's Token. 

Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.

Yeah, get with the times, dude. 

Oh.

I'm having the best time!

Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!

Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!

No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.

Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!

I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.

Oh that's good.

Where? 

Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.

Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 

So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.

Did you go yet?

Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.

All right!

Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.

Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.

What do we do with it?

...Shuttle?

People are saying that? 

It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!

Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!

Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!

Pst, Cartman.

Ohh, dude, get me out of here!

Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 

Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.

Kyle, look! It's them.

Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!

No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.

Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.

I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!

Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.

We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!

Kyle! Run! 

All right, all right, all right! God! 

Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?

No.

Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 

Look, I really need my bike.

Aw, dude, come on!!

"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"

Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.

Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?

We did it! Yeah!

Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.

Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 

Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?

Yeah.

Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?

Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 

No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 

Uh. We've been taking care of him.

Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?

They both look the same. 

I wanted my job!

Your eyes? 

Pick me up. I... I want to see. 

Butters.

We know what you are, lady!

Hey, yeah! 

Uuh. Thanks.

Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.

Cartman?

I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 

Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!

Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 

But no! I have to get the girls to come-

Dude, sick!!! 

Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.

We got it.

Thetan levels...

That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.

I'll do it! I'll be in charge.

Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.

There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.

He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 

If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 

With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.

Huh??

No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!

Daaaad!

What do you think happens if you do have it?

A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!

...they've killed Kenny!

You dumbass, Cartman!

I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. 

Now we'll never know where that pet store is!

That's cool.

Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.

That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!

...What?

Cartman??

Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.

What?

Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.

You're a sinner!

Oh no! No nononononono!

Dude, no way.

What?

How long was that?

Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.

There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.

Phew.

What's that?

Fine!

Okay okay, take the form of something else!

So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?

Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. 

So what are we gonna do for New Year's?

...A what?

The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!

ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!

Wow!

This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 

What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 

Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.

And I say, "Dare!"

Damn it! 

Dude, what is this place?

How much?

How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?

He's alive!

Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.

Thanks a lot.

The kid will never even know.

Tell them not to burn us down.

All families suck ass!

Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!

We've got to learn how to do that, dude!

Ah, damn it, I can't do it!

I guess so.

No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!

Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.

Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.

Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.

Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.

I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.

YOU told me it was a lie!

Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?

Hey! Hey, open the door!

Uh, no! I hate that toy!

Aha! 

Kyle?

What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.

Hey, hey! What are you doing?!

Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.

If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.

Butters, what the hell are you doing?

Shut up Cartman!

You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!

Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.

Oh my God, that means...

Butters, what the hell are you doing?

Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!

Over here!  Jump down! Go! 

Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.

I don't know.

Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 

One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 

What did he do?

What?

Quick, we need something to carry him in!

Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...

Watch my coat, dude.

Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 

This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.

Look, there's the F-word.

All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!

We're not dealing drugs!

But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 

The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.

Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.

Huh?

Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.

We did it!

Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!

Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?

Oh-h. Nowhere. 

He looks like a guy.

Dad??

And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 

What?!

Chef!

We'll hold 'em off.

Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 

Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?

Get them out of there!

Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!

Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.

Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.

It... did?

Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.

Oh, hey Dad.

Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.

Wh-why?

Goddamn, that took a long time.

Dad! You've gotta help me! 

Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?

I found this frozen guy in the woods today.

Is this hunting?

Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 

This is stupid.

There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.

I can't see, dude!

Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.

All right, I'm turning around

Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?

What are you doing, dad?

Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?

Yeah, yeah, we do!

He's lying. 

Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 

Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!

Dad, we're going back!

I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.

Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 

Kind of bitter.

Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.

Yeah it does.

Don't kill Kenny!

But you only need one, fat boy!

No! I never cut if off!

What?

He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!

Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.

Marry him?

Yeah!

Yeah.

Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.

Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?

We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 

Hello?

How do you know?!

Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 

It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-

Yeah.

What?

I feel like total shit.

Yeah!

Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 

...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Yeah?

Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.

Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!

I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.

This is gonna be one looong-ass day. 

No, dude, it was totally fine.

That isn't funny, Cartman.

Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!

Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?

Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!

Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 

...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!

Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.

No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 

Heather? 

What?!

Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?

We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.

Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.

Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?

What happened??

Yeah!

Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!

But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.

Oh no, he didn't.

Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.

A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.

No, Towelie, the entry code!

Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.

I don't know.

Yeah I'm ready!

We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?

Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!

He'll do it, dude.

It might hold the key to a curse.

But we have to watch the commercials in this show.

No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!

Please, I don't wanna go back with them.

Hey Wendy.

Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.

I don't get it, Kenny.

Whoopee!

Butters!

No, we just fake it to shut him up.

What can I do?

Dude, we are on the front page!

Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.

Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.

Uuuuh...

No.

Please, it's important.

The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.

Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!

No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.

The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.

Come on, guys! 

What?

Shut up, Cartman.

Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.

Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.

Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 

'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.

Taser... 

How do we stretch that into five minutes?

Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.

Kyle, you gotta see!! 

Aw, really?

Wow, he IS great at sucking.

Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.

Yeah. 

Wow, this is happening so fast.

...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-

All right, come on, guys. 

Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.

Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.

I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.

Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 

Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.

Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!

Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas

I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.

Yes?

What do you think, Officer Barbrady?

Yeah, who cares?

My parents will never let me keep a goat

Dad!  You're the greatest. 

No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.

What, dude?

Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?

No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.

...Yes, I'm serial.

Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?

No.

...Thanks a lot, dude.

You guys are watchin' murder porn?

Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.

If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?

All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.

I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 

Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!

Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 

I don't know what the hell that is...

It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.

Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!

Your what?

All right, so how do I join you?

What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!

Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.

Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?

Are you serious? We never heard that.

Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.

Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.

All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!

Cool!

Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!

You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!

Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 

Let's go, Kyle! 

Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.

Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!

Better than yours, fat boy.

Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.

I called you an ass-sucker!

Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!

Why does that matter?

I see it!

First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!

No, I just, I don' know. No.

What?!

Ugh.

Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!

Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!

We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 

That's probably okay if you spread it out.

I'm not gonna kill you grampa.

Yeah!

...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!

No, they're leaving.

I'm good.

Hello?

What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.

It's gotta be our turn soon.

Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.

It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.

Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.

Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.

...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.

Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?

Wow.

Blaaa-lalalalalalala.

Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!

That's not your mom calling!

Yes!

Uh, Earth?

But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-

No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.

Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 

What's that?

Huh?!  O-oh.

Where'd you get that?

Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?

Awww!

How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?

Thanks. 

Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.

But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.

Come on guys, we might as well go. 

...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.

When do we want it?

Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 

What is that?

That was freakin' hardcore.

Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.

What do we want?

Yeah.

Hey, Jesus.

Dude, I really don't see a problem.

No wait.

Hey Chef.

Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.

You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 

So?

Heh hey wait a minute dude.

Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?

I don't believe it.

Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.

Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?

Yeah, let's go race it right now!

Milkshakes?!

If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!

I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!

Why not?!

Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 

Fine! 

Come on!

I'll bet you can.

My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-

You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.

They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.

How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!

I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 

But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!

Don't care, don't care, don't care.

I haven't been sleeping well.

Yeah, awesome!

Aw, come, on dude! This is history.

Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!

So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?

You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.

Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.

You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.

Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.

One?

Really?

Are we homophobes now?

We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.

Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.

Who's Captain Hindsight?

We need to talk.

We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!

Do I really have to do this, Dad?

Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.

Okay, that's good, a little higher.

Oh my God, he killed Kenny!

What, you mean, Kyle?

Ow! 

Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.

What??

Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 

Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.

Mom, go look outside.

Ow!

Huh?

We did it! We did it!

Come on, Kyle! 

Kyle!

Your family is rich, dude.

If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!

Shelly?

Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 

When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!

What? He did.

No!

Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.

So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

Shut up Kyle!

How do you guys make them so yummy?

I don't. She's totally lame. 

Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?

That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.

Holy shit!

The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.

Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.

Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 

Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.

Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?

I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.

We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!

What's it say? What's it say?

Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?

Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?

Yeah, I know.

I'm outta here; see ya guys. 

None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!

Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.

It'll get better, guys.

"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!

Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...

Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him

Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!

Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!

What's that?

Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Can you hit a target, Pip?

Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.

Yeah.

Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.

Holy crap! 

I told you that would work!

God-damn!

Yes?

I can't. 

What the hell happened here? 

We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!

You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...

Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? 

...Kenny would have done it.

Agggghhh! 

We're not straight! You're straight!

Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?

Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 

The Imagination song?

Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.

Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider

Whoa, that was cool! 

What are we supposed to do with it?

How's it going, Cartman?

Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!

Yeah.

What is that?

Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?

A B.J.?

We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.

...What, what was the question again?

They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.

All right! Let's do this!

Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!

Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?

I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.

No, I was supposed to be home at eight.

I took out the garbage yesterday.

Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 

No problem, Gorak.

Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 

Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?

When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.

God-damnit, this is ridiculous.

Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!

Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.

I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 

Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.

Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.

No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!

Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.

Wendy, why is it such a big deal?

No dude, you're a douche.

Huh?

That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.

What is that?

Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."

We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.

No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 

Dude, this is awesome.

No.

Yeah.

Oh.

Oh Jesus, he's about to play! 

Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!

Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.

I don't care! We're going!

Hooray!

Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 

Hey dude.

Yes, now get out of here.

Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 

Could you just hand us some food please?

Cartman?

Kyle, you have to keep playing.

Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!

Um, cool.

So do you know anything that can help him?

Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 

Dude, are you okay?

No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?

This is going great!

You don't?

Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. 

What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 

See what?

I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--

Oh no.

Yeah.

Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?

He was right. You DID cause 9/11.

Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!

It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!

Let's watch something else.

Yeah, sure, what about it?

What?? 

You did throw it away, Cartman.

Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.

We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.

As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 

Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.

Uhh... no.

Come on, fatass, we have to go!

But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!

Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?

But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.

You do?

Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.

Okay. Action! 

We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?

'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.

See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."

Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

Holy crap. dude!

Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 

We've come to... ask you for help.

That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?

God, it took forever!

We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?

Shut up, Cartman?

Jesus... we have to get out of here. 

Trick or treat.

It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 

Well I don't drink coffee.

I don't want your lame-ass supper!

B-bani-banishment?

Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.

We should- 

You're gonna have to tell him, dude.

Huh?

Dude, what?

And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 

I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.

Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 

Where's Gobbles, Timmy?

We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 

I believe. 

No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 

W-what did you get in a fight about?

I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.

Okay, hold it, hold it. 

That isn't funny.

Where?

We go get the doll ourselves.

Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.

Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.

Uh that sounds like shit too.

Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.

Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.

And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!

Round one is over. We made it. 

You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.

No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.

What?! Kyle?!

Wendy?

Hey!  Wait a minute!

Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?

So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.

Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!

All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.

Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.

Okay.

Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.

But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.

Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.

Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!

Can you see anything? 

Calm down, tubby.

Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.

Are they good?

Yes! It's over! It's over!

You tricked us, Cartman!

Because that's what we're doing!

That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.

Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 

Butters called Customer Service first?

We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!

No, I'll go! I found him!

No, you just have to study.

So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!

I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.

He's right there.

Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 

Thanks for your help, Wendy.

I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.

Who did?

Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.

No!

He could be half bear, half manpig.

Oh, man, that's terrible.

Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!

Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.

Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.

Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-

I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.

It's all right, dad.

There! The television department!

Right on.

Dude, you're not gonna believe this.

Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?

No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.

Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?

Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.

Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?

...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!

Yeah, I wouldn't have.

You said "hand over the bunny."

I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.

O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?

Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.

Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!

Goddamnit, what now?!

No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?

Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.

You call the number Kyle.

Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.

That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?

Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 

You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.

I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.

Ya see, Craig? 

Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.

So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.

That seems kind of... weird.

Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-

I...

Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.

Sure dude.

There it is. The Okama GameSphere. 

Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 

Mph. 

Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.

Headgear?  What headgear?

I didn't smile. 

Sparky! Sparky!

Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!

Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.

Sshh!

Why?

And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!

What?! You can't let them do that!

Yeah.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.

What, you got asthma or something?

It's cool dude, we understand.

Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!

We've gotta hurry this up. 

Oh God, here we go again.

...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.

Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.

Hwat??

Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?

Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!

Help.

It might be a way out, Craig!

Wow, that's cool!

No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!

The whole thing is a joke!

Look! There he is!

Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!

Dude, we can't do that

Oh, Goddammit! 

Okay, let's try it again. Hup!

You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.

Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?

It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 

One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.

How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?

But you said that there were-

...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.

Run, Blanket, Run!

What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 

We know, we know, that's what everybody says.

If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?

Uh. Hi.

No, dad, no. No, please!

Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.

His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.

Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.

Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?

Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?

Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.

Praise Christ.

Kyle, we all agreed to do this!

Yeah, of course. 

No!

Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.

A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!

Dude, come on!

You do?

Super weak.

Craig's new show?

Oh.

I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.

Why do you say that?

Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 

But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.

Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!

Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!

Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! 

Then you're a stupid douche

The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.

Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!

That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!

Let me see.

Oh...

Hi, Jesus. It's me,

Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 

Wow, that was short. 

Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?

...What do you know about the leprechaun?

You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Sure, for what?

Good. A-and action! 

Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!

Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.

Okay, we will.

Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah

Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!

Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.

All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.

Why do dogs have cold noses?

Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.

Oh my God!

He looks pretty happy to me.

Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.

What the hell is wrong with these people?!

Woww.

Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.

Alright, I'll chip in.

What?

Yeah, it's not bad. Next? 

Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.

Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.

This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.

I'll try

God damn it.

Stop it! I didn't do anything!

What?!

We don't wanna see them, Cartman! 

Try to do what you wanna do!

Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?

It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.

Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.

Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!

No.

Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."

Nice speech, nerdo.

How are you feeling?

Hey, Kenny.

All right. Let's work it!  What the...?

Stop it, Mom!

Yes, Mr. Garrison.

Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!

Call an ambulance.

Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.

Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!

He wants to know where he is.

Who are you people?

Well I can't spend any money.

I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!

That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.

AAAA! 

Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.

Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.

What?

I wonder if it's all a western?

Dude, I'm almost dead.

Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Wow, really?!

We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.

Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 

Damn!

Whoa!

Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 

Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!

Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.

That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 

Wow. Hi, Wendy.

Dude, what happened?

'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.

Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.

Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?

"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.

Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!

Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.

Yeah?

Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.

Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"

Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-

I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 

Yeah, pretty much.

We did it! 

Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Accept it! 

We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...

His name is Gorak!

What?

When do we want it?

We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.

I can't believe that fat asshole!

The fish!  But-.

Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?

Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!

I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!

Oh, ah thank God you found me.

Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?

No, no-no-no.

Nnnothing, nothing.

It just all seemed so... stupid.

I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.

Goddammit!

I don't understand!

So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.

Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.

Wait a minute. There they are!

Hi, Wendy.

I'm sure glad that's over with. 

What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.

No, no, it's not that.

It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.

Dude, what are you saying??

He's just confused.

Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!

Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. 

Aw shit, it's him again.

Okay. 

Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?

A wall toilet for peeing in.

I know!

I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.

We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.

It's not?

We won't! 

Oh man, really?

Wow!

Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.

Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?

It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!

What?

Come on! This stupid light won't change.

Come on, we're running out of time. 

My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.

Aw- awww!

Dude. We lost.

Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.

Sure I will grampa, I will.

My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.

Jimmy didn't stop them!

AAAAAAAA!

It's time for what?

Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!

Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 

Oh, boy.

You'll see! We'll get in! 

Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??

Chef, we have to talk to you!

They found me!

My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.

Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 

Dude, he did that to me this morning.

Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.

Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?

I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.

Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!

We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 

What?

Yeah!

It's cool, dude. We'll help you.

Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.

Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!

It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.

What's "lose bowel control?"

Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!

There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 

No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!

It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.

In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!

I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.

What?

No, it can't be.

Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!

Oh.

Dad, it's not that big a deal.

Dad! Dad, they shot at us.

Oh no, what now? 

Oh shit!

Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-

Just a second fat-ass!

Stop! Stop! 

So, this is gonna make me happy?

Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!

What?

Oh no.

Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??

Kicked out? Oh no!

Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!

We got you covered, Timmy.

Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?

Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.

He's really got it out for you, dude.

No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.

Yeah, at least one-fourth.

Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 

Awww dude, awwww.

I know. 

Oh, no, nononono.

What seems pointless?

I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-

What?

No.

I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 

Oh Jesus!

Well?

Oh all right.

It wa a trick!

Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 

That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?

Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!

I... said it would really bum them out.

What?!

Really?

Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.

You can't!

Jesus Christ, dude!

Come on, guys. 

Not here! Go further away!

I don't know!

Well, what about going to hell and all that?!

What'd they say?

I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.

Cut! Cartman!

Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!

I just wanted my period.

Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 

No.

What the hell is he doing?

From Vietnam veterans.

Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?

Yeah, I remember hearing about that.

Yeah, huh, I got you!

Oh crap! It's that guy again! 

What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.

Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.

Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!

Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.

What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.

Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?

Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.

George Clooney's acceptance speech?

Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.

Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!

Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.

You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!

Wow, dude.

What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?

Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 

Awww God! 

Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!

You're not?

Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.

Fine! 

Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.

Butters, Goddammit.

Wow, coo-hul!

to make it spin.

Oh, boy. You've done it now.

...Farmers in where?

Yes you do! Now, dig! 

They look fine to me. 

Yeah, golf is stupid again. 

Snowball! 

Closed?

Kyle, I need to use your Internet

No, I think you oughta.

Standing by in three seconds.

Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?

Ohhh hey guys.

Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!

There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 

I know.

Dad, we're gonna crash!

I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.

What are you talking about?

No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 

Hey, it's Big Gay Al!

Help me chip some of the ice away.

No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.

Uh, we didn't do it.

But they kill people.

Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.

Some, kids from Orange County.

Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!

Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?

Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."

Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 

Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?

Okay, next? 

No, mom!

Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.

Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 

Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?

Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?

They're not gonna kill us.

See? That's what happened to me!

Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?

Dad, what are you doing?!

It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!

Enough! I know!

What? 

Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.

Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.

But Mo-o-o-

Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!

What are you goin' to do, dude?

Agh!

Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.

We're the ones you told to get Internet money.

Hey. Where's Kenny?

Uh huh, Stan Marsh.

That's what they made me think, too!

It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.

Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.

You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.

...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.

Wow, really? 

What?

I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"

What what do I do?

Why?

A hook.

What?  Howdy. 

O-ogh...

It's genius.

Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?

Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!

Just run with it, dude.

This is more math than I've ever seen you do.

Oh, no. 

We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 

This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 

Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  

Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!

Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.

We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.

Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!

We made it!

She has to! 

We shot all those videos and sent them in.

Oh uh, hey Nelson.

Awgh!  Oh thank God.

Come on, guys! 

It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.

Yeah.

Hey, Chef!

That does it, dude!

Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.

Good morning, Miss Crabtree.

All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.

Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 

Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.

With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?

Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!

Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!

Yeah, and then what?

I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!

It's still three weeks.

Ooogh.

Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!

I thought albums win either gold or platinum.

Sure I do!

That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 

Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 

To the sewer, dude.

Dude, he's wasted.

It's starting, it's starting!

Yeah, but... how?

No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.

This is gonna be so sweet, dude.

I guess.

No, you don't!

A-ah huh.

Oh never mind, I hate him again.

I'll kick your ass, Cartman! 

Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!

What?

No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.

Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!

Fries... fries...

I guess... 

Wait, look! The helicopter! 

You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?

Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?

You didn't find him, I found him.

Yeah, he looks terrible.

That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.

Hey dudes.

Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?

You were awesome, Token!

Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!

No way.

What?

I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!

Okay, there. 

Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!

Thanks for the ride, Manuel.

Can you climb back up, dude?

Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 

He made it down. 

Hoh. Hoh?

Craig, are we still clear?

But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.

Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.

Who is that?

All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.

That's übercool.

Wendy, look! 

Okay... 

Yeahhhh!

...Yeah.

Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?

Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.

Come on, people. Come on, people now.

Good job, wizard.

Dude, what are you doing?

He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.

Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?

Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 

It... it was right here.

Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?

What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 

But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!

Wendy, did you hear about last night?

We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 

We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 

Oh

Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.

What?!

Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?

There she is!

Butters?

Bluuch! I'd love to. 

Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.

Yeah, it's all set.

But we need you!

Hey, he talks!

I have no idea...

All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 

God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.

Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."

So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.

I have a button we can use for his nose.

This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.

"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".

Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?

Nothing.  Hey, kid!

What are they doing here?

You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!

No??

You're on!

What's he want?

Go ahead, dude. 

I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.

...Whoops.

Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!

I guess this is it.

I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 

It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.

Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!

Phillip! Phillip!

Hello there, Chef.

The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.

Well, you sure seem happy about it!

What the hell's going on?!

I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!

Goddamnit Cartman, what?! 

So what does that mean?

Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 

Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!

This spot looks good. 

It sure did.

Oh dude, there goes one.

Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!

An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.

Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 

Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 

Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.

Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?

Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.

Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?

Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 

Shhh! Here comes Cartman.

Guys. Look. 

We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 

Really?

Oh, hi, Wendy.

Have you seen any panda bears?

You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.

Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.

Eh hey, could you tell me how I-

Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.

I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.

And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.

So, how far is it to Nebraska?

Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?

G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.

Nice job, Pip.

Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.

Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 

Jesus Christ. 

Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?

Kenny says that's not what it means.

Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!

Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?

Yeah!

I guess.

Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.

You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.

No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.

I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 

How?

There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 

Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?

No way, dude!

Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.

Whoa!

AGGGGGGHHHHHH!

I can't. I'm busy.

Damn, dude. 

Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.

They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.

Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.

Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 

Oh, really??

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Me neither.

...WHAT??

Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?

We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.

No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.

Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 

I don't know. 

That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!

Dude!

Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.

Yeah, Timmy ruhules!

Yeah. Wait, what?

Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.

Uh, over here please?

You can't stay here.

Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?

Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!

We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!

No??

Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 

But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!

Quick, call Kyle.

Jesus Christ!

I know.

This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'

I don't think so.

No you're not! I don't think I missed any!

This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.

Dude...

... What?

No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.

No, he's not.

Uh... war?

He's really old and going blind.

Weak!  Dad?

Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.

So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?

Chef, we're leaving.

I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!

We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.

Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.

Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!

Oh, weak. 

Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 

No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac

We're in!

He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.

I want a breast!

I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.

You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.

Dude, they're gonna kill me.

Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!

Uuuuhh.

You aren't alone. 

And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.

Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!

Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 

But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-

That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 

Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?

And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!

No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.

We'll see about that!

I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!

We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!

Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-

Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.

And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.

Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?

What?!

Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.

'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!

What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.

Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on! 

Thanks. 

Aw, damnit!

We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!

I'm totally depressed.

Why?

Exactly!

Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?

Well that burned a long time.

Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?

Yeah, go Broncos.

They're still asleep.

That's a haiku?

Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.

And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.

...Wow. 

Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?

Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.

What'd they say?

Uh, come on, let's go. 

Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!

The 2001 Okama GameSphere?

He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.

No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.

Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.

No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 

Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?

Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.

Whoa, cool! 

You were looking for a talent agent?

Blanket, you in here?

Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 

But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?

Where did it go?  Huhhh. 

What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.

Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!

To where?

Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.

I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.

Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg

We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!

Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.

Damn, Cartman!

I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.

Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?

...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.

Hurry up, you guys!

For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!

Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.

No!

Oh wait, who am I again?

Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!

I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.

Gorak!

Ha! They're your diseases!

NO! 

...Oh-kay.

Yeah, quit being such a baby.

All right!

Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?

Mr. Mackey!

And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.

We did it. 

Guinea pigs?

We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!

She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.

Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...

Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.

No thanks. I'll stand.

Hey, you guys came back!

Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?

Man! That sucked, getting searched. 

Take that you stupid Indian! 

Got it.

Where's your costume, fatass?

Butters!

Presents.

What? Hey! 

I, I can't.

All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.

Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!

I think he might've run away.

Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.

I don't know about this Chef.

Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.

Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.

Well, yeah.

Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?

We did it!

They're not?

Cartman??

You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 

I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.

The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 

We did it! We did it!

That was sick, dude!

This is happening way too fast.

I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.

Where have you been, Cartman?

Wh-what could it be? 

Dude!

My locker?

What the hell do you think you're doing?!

Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

Oh, thank God.

Dude. Shut up, Cartman.

We have come to reclaim the one tape! 

Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!

Pfft whatever.

It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.

We knew he wouldn't make it.

No problems at all!

Dude, we we have to go check this out.

Sparky'll kick his ass.

...Um, no?

What does he mean, "living in denial"?

Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-

Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.

Right, so how do we get back at them?

No.

What's a prostitute?

Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.

You're gonna fight Satan?

Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.

This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!

Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!

Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.

Help!

I'll try again.

Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?

Come on, dude! 

Is that legal?

They've already accomplished so much.

And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 

Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.

No! No! 

Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.

My ass we will!

But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.

Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.

Are we gonna go to hell?

Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.

I wanna return a fish.

What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!

Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.

Dude, he's incredible.

Okay, here he comes. 

Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?

Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.

She doesn't have any lips!

Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?

Dad, let's just wait our turn.

...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.

NO!

What?

'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.

We're making faces at sick people.

Wow, that sucks, dude.

Hey, Cartman!

I'm not going to kill you grampa!

So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.

Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.

Really?  People who are doing something?

Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!

Hey, look!

Vince McMahon is coming to see us?

Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?

Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.

That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.

Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.

Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?

Two thousand dollars.

Come on, dude!

Dude, this is creepy.

That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!

No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.

Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.

What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 

Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.

I think so. 

So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 

Heh, heh.  Sorry.

Cartman, what are you doing?

But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.

Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...

Hey, who's that fat chick?

Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?

Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?

Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!

Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!

Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.

What the fuck?

Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!

Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 

So, what now?

Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.

Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.

Dude, we never thought you were cool.

I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.

You shut up,  gaywad!

So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?

All the world destroyed?

Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!

Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.

...Nnnno, there isn't. 

That's amazing!

What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!

Are you guys fucking serious?

Bitch.

That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!

It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?

Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.

Dude! Dude, not cool!

Dad, no!  You killed my father. 

They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."

No dude, you gotta help us find him!

You forgot!

Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 

What's that?

Uh huh.

But we don't like her.

Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!

You got it, Ken? 

We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!

Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"

You're Chef's parents?

Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.

It's gonna be alright, Kyle.

You doing okay, Ms. Spears? 

Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 

Blockbuster Video?

Yeah, I think I get it.

You can't just leave me here alone.

Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!

Hey, I didn't throw up.

You guys... need... anything? 

Yeah, me too.

Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.

I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.

Yeah, we need condoms!

What's a "tooth trade?"

That isn't it at all. 

You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.

No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.

It... kind of sounds like shit.

Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!

Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.

Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.

Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?

I have no idea.

Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.

What the hell is that?

See? She liked my present the best!

Kyle, come on!

Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 

Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.

Mom!

It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.

No, I just--

Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 

The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.

That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?

Aww, do I have to?

What is it, Mom?

Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 

Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.

Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!

It's right there, see? 

That's not me, that's you!

What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.

I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.

Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.

We sit.

Kyle! Kyle, don't!

Television? 

Why? 

But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?

Yeah.

Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 

Chef, we love you.

Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.

Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?

I- told them where to find you.

Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 

No. I broke the dam.

What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?

Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!

Yeah, what are you? A child molester?

Sure dude.

But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?

I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!

If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??

Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.

What?

Aww, it's all warm!

Wow, you remember him?

Can't believe we have to go to school!

Dude, I'm not going.

Whattaya mean?

I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.

Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?

Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.

Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?

Really.

What the fuck?

Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.

I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.

Jesus, you did answer my prayer! 

You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 

Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.

Oh no! 

Ah! Oh, dude!

"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."

Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!

Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 

Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.

RPG, four o'clock!

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?

I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.

I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.

You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.

Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.

Dad! Dad!

Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!

Hey there, little guy.

Oh no!

Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!

What is it?

No.

What's so funny about that?

When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 

Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.

Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!

So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.

A what?

Yeah.

Turn it up. 

It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!

Well, you're mountain lions.

I'm not bleeding out my aahass!

Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!

Jesus.

Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.

What?

You did, Jesus. 

Cartman!

Butters, we're running away!

Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!

Come on, Tweek! You got him!

I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 

Excuse us. Excuse us.

Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 

Dude! 

Alright, we made it!

...Yyyeah.

But Cartman, we're trying to--

I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.

Yeah.

Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.

You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?

And she's at a hotel in our town. 

Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.

A whatbian?

Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.

Token sings?

Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..

Yeah. 

Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?

Yeah. It does. 

It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?

All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.

Oh, yes we do.

Thanks a lot, Frida!

We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.

Dude, you really are sick, huh?

Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 

Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.

Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?

Yeah yeah, not bad.

Seven and two.

Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!

Chef, what's a prostitute?

Dude, it's Timmy.

Dude, they're never gonna let us through.

Yes.

Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!

I knew we could do it!

Goddamnit, that pissed me off!

Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 

So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." 

Not that. Did you actually go to that?

Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.

Wuh, that smells. 

We told you dude.

What happened??

Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 

Bleech!

We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.

You what?!

Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?

What?!

Day five. I made it!  Hello?

So?

Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.

Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?

Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!

Come on, people. Come on, people now. 

I do.

I wouldn't care.

I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!

What??

Dad!

All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.

Oh God, don't care, don't care.

It was seriously almost hard to watch. 

Knock it off! 

What's a succubus?

Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.

We have to do something. Let's form a club.

Dad, I'm scared.

She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.

Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.

Yes, we're here.

Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?

See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!

They did?

Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.

Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 

What?!

Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?

But Mom...

Butters!

You really think he'll die in Somalia?

Kiss my ass!

How can you eat when you're farting fire?

Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!

You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 

Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.

Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 

I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?

Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?

Ah, dude, you don't say that.

' G'oh?

Really, what about?

I'll try again.

My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.

Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 

Cartman?

Okaaay. 

All right, they finally came for us. 

Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.

Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.

Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!

Yay.

Stay gold. 

Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.

We're dead!

This guy rules!

Oh.

Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.

Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 

How do we do it?

Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.

I' seems fine.

This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!

Cartman, you idiot!

Sso?

Over?  Jesus...

Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.

That's not neato, that sucks.

We want three tickets to the North Pole. 

Hello. We need to go...  here. 

I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.

What?

That trick sucks, Jesus.

No, uh, it just explains a lot.

Oh shit.

D'you know John Elway?

Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.

Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.

Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.

Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.

Hey.

He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.

It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.

There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.

That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.

Chef, come on!

Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.

Bluuch. Kick ass!

Rad! 

He's the fat one.

Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?

What? 

Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 

I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.

Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 

My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.

Dude, fuck you!

Huh?

I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

What? 

Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.

Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.

Dude, what the hell is your problem?!

Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?

Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.

Will you stop that?

Haaa! 

You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.

I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.

Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.

HA!

Oh, dude, we finished level 50!

What are we gonna do with them?

Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 

Get down Sparky! Down!

Dad? Is that you?

That would be best.

Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!

Sure.

We are making a music video.

Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?

We do what we can, sir.

Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?

Stan. Marsh.

Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!

Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?

Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.

Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?

Cartman dude, not now.

I asked you guys to help me and you said no!

Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 

'Cause I need to know why she broke up.

Do what?

It was just decimation.

I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.

Dude!

Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.

What the hell is wrong with everybody?

All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.

All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.

Wow, it sucks he has to leave.

Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 

What the hell? 

Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.

Do you really think we should go with this guy?

Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.

Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?

Oh, hey.

This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!

How much is this going to cost us?

Dude, what's the matter?

Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-

You got a computer?

Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!

I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?

Hey, where's Kyle?

Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 

You, you do? How?

Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.

God! Shut up!

Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!

The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.

Let's just go, Let's just go! 

This is sweet, huh Kenny? 

So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 

Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.

Huh? 

That didn't sparkle with her, did it?

Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.

Why did Chef quit?

No!

But it's just crap.

I don't know. 

Hey, yeah!

Here he comes.

Is Bebe home?

No, I can't even kill a deer.

Hell yeah! 

Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 

Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!

What?

No!

Kiya! Kiya!

Yeah, but, mom!

This is hopeless!

Fine!

No, you don't!

Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.

Huh? Hello? Who is that? 

What are you talking about, dude?!

That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?

I don't know.

I'm gonna go on the slides.

Let's have a cup o-Aaaa! 

That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.

Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 

Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?

What?

Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.

Wow!

Look! 

The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!

Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.

Where do handicapped people go when they die?

Oh.

Oh no. 

God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 

Sorry.

Dude, are these all your toys?

Dude, look.

So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?

Because, I know what did cause the flood.

Dude, don't be nervous.

Cartman, are you feeling alright?

Aooooo!

Butters, is there any way out of here?

Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!

Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.

Ah fuck.

Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.

...Dude.

The... Book of Mormon? What's that?

There is... one person.

Huh?

I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 

It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?

No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

That's impossible!

What are you talking about, dude?

That's all I needed. 

Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!

Where's Gorak??

...Wow.

Because we wanna see Kenny again. 

Who are you?

But it's super-cool!

Yahtzee?

Hooray!

Hide and go seek, huh?!

That's just an old legend.

Can we go, please?

Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 

Who's that?

Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?

Bo-ring.

But that's just you and your friends.

Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.

Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.

I'll try again.

That would suck so much ass.

Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?

Hello? Can anybody hear me?

Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.

I think we have to signal them somehow.

Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.

Ogh.

Okay.

Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.

What's all gone?

Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!

What the hell do you want?!

Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!

Yeah.

He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.

Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 

Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!

That's it, that's the whole story?

You didn't know that?

Thanks. Who are you?

But I don't know any of this stuff.

Okay, thanks, Towelie. 

Well alright. 

Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.

Cartman, why are you doing this?

Um, I'm not really prepared either.

I know, Mom. I love you too.

Sick!

It was the fish! 

I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 

Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?

Yeah, yeah!

What?

Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.

Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??

Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.

It's... nice.

I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?

Like who?

Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!

I don't know. 

I can shoot you, fat ass!

Dad, how did you get that?!

Dad?

That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.

Don't let him get away!

Helen!

Dude, we can't work with this kid.

Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!

Oh dude! Oh Jesus!

Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 

Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 

Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!

Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.

Yeah. 

I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.

Awww..!

Oh I'm ready!

You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!

Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.

Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?

We're going as fast as we can!

I guess.

Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.

Why do you have to see an eye doctor?

to make it spin.

Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 

Back in the third grade.

Word of curse?

Yeah, Cartman's pee.

Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!

Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls

That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 

No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!

Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?

I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 

But they raped Indiana Jones!

Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!

What does it want?

I think so.

Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!

Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.

Okay.

Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.

Dad? Dad!

I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!

I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 

Well go on, then! Sue me!

Yeah, it's unbelievable.

What's that?

Whatever happened to Kenny?

Boy, I'll say!

Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.

This is great!

Ogh. 

I'm not playing, I'm coaching.

Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!

Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?

Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.

Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.

Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!

Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 

We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 

I don't know,  I just like it.

She's not my girlfriend.

Just leave me alone!

No, no, we didn't--

What??

Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.

Aw, do we have to?

This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!

We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.

The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?

Yeah, that's basically it.

When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.

Going away party? What do you mean?

Hey, what the hell!

Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.

Yea, please!

"Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!

No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.

So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?

He's such a douchebag

I will Big Gay Al, I will. 

No.

Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!

Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 

Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!

Sure thing, Bebe.

Awww!

Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.

Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!

What are you doing?!

Even in the girls' bathroom! 

Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 

Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.

Okay.  One.

No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.

Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 

No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 

Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 

Go where?

Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! 

Hundred bucks, no big whoop.

Dude, wanna do some math problems?

"So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"

No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.

Bubye, Fartboy.

The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 

Did you ask the Vamp kids?

No.

...Enchirito?

I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!

Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!

Aw crap. 

What, Butters?

We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!

No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.

I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.

Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?

No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?

Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.

What??

More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.

Costumes? 

Come on, dude. 

We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.

Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.

Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 

Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!

What? 

Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.

Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?

Where am I supposed to go?

Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?

Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!

Yeah, dude.

You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.

Grampa!

Aw, dude, this looks like shit.

Ahta! 

Come on, let's go. 

It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.

Why?!

Yeu-bluuuch. 

Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?

My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.

I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!

Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!

I like it.

Aw crap!

What? That's it?

What?

Oh, brother.

Yeah, they need to shut it off.

What's no big deal?

Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.

Oh my God! She killed Kenny!

Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.

That's right! 

No!

...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!

Uuugh!

Yeah, what's the problem?

Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 

Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?

Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!

What's going on?

Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.

I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody

Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.

Hey Kenny.

Wait, I don't get it.

What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?

Stop!

Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?

Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.

Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.

No! I broke the fucking dam!

You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?

What was that? 

Kyle. Kyle, wake up.

Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.

Smell what?

(Dude!)

Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.

Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.

You speak English.

Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?

...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?

I think we have to signal them somehow.

You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!

You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?

Could you pull over so I can get out?

And that has something to do with their medicines because...?

Like what?

You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!

Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.

Because our names were called on the commercial last night!

Yeah, that's better.

Dude, sweet! 

SNAAAKE! 

Yeah, I think that's great too.

Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 

We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 

...Yeah, screw that bitch.

Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!

That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 

Cartman, no!

Doing what?

Butters!

Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.

What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!

Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.

Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?

It's all right, just a scratch.

I'm going home.

Oh, hey Kenny.

It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.

Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!

What?! Why?!

Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!

This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!

...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.

Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.

He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.

Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?

No!

...Yeah.

Grandpa.

Cool.

What are you talking about?

Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?

No, no, we don't hang out anymore.

Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?

Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!

I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!

That's true.

Put that away, dude! 

No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!

Okay, fine. 

Hello?

Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.

Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 

Dude, we don't remember.

Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.

You're not?

Did you like the old one?

Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.

We don't have any weapons.

That's all it is? 

What other crime in South Park?

Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.

Hormones? 

Sure, dude, you're our friend.

Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.

Run, dude, run!!

Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!

I, I guess.

Dude!

They're not.

Here it is. Motivation Corp. 

Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.

We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.

Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.

What? What's the big deal?

Alright, let's go see what he wants. 

Oh no... 

Why not just pull over?

But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?

Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?

He's just dancing around.

Dad?

Today, we've made history.

No way!

Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 

We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-

And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.

That's your flight, Butters.

Ho! 

You're not more mature than us, Cartman!

Dude, we need you.

So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 

Oh no.

Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?

But we don't care!

Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.

Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.

You're on, fatass! 

MMOOMM!

Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 

Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?

Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.

Hi, doctor. 

We're not rednecks!

No.

...So take it with you!

Mom, I'm 10 years old now.

Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! 

Now, do you believe this, Cartman?

Oh man, this is another rerun.

Wendy?

We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.

Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.

He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 

Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.

Hero-Heroin Hero?

Well dude, somebody has got to go down!

Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 

What was that? 

Give us some, Cartman!

You tell 'em, Kyle!

Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.

Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!

So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?

My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 

Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.

Aaanh, he does this all the time.

Hey Craig.

During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!

I literally broke the dam!

Can you leave the light on, Dad?

Kyle??

Here we go. 

Oh my God! Look! 

Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!

Aw dude, that's so sad. 

No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!

Shut up, fatass! 

Oh no, what now?

Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?

You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.

Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?

No, that's okay.

Just stay still, Butters.

Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.

All right, fine. 

Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.

I don't wanna go back there.

I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.

Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 

Kyle??

Go away! Shoo! 

Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.

Knew what?

Cool.

We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 

So this is normal?

Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'

Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.

I think you're pushing it.

Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!

Uh-oh.

I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!

To the moon?

You scram! We were here first!

I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?

What are you doing grampa?

Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?

The addict people said something about me filling a hole.

Whoa!

Wow, you made this?

Yeah.

Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!

Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.

So what should we do?

"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!

I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.

We told you that.

What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!

'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.

Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!

You got it!

This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??

Yeah, it's pretty weird. 

Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 

Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.

Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!

Are we in trouble or something?

So?

What's High School Musical 1 and 2?

Huh??

Wow, we look great!

Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.

So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?

Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!

No, he's not.

Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.

Not today... yet.

Dad, what are you doing?!

Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.

Dude, what the hell was that?

Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.

Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!

I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 

What?

I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!

Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.

Dude, please. Kyle needs it.

...who are you people?!

Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?

Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.

Why?! Don't you know?!

I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.

Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.

Jesus Christ...

Dude, what the hell?

We only have music class on Thursday.

Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?

NO.

Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!

Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.

Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!

Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?

Wait, you have guns here?

Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.

He does? 

Well it's just a little messy.

Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.

Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 

Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.

Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!

Jesus Christ, dude! 

She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.

And then Token, and then me.

Dude, why are you so into their relationship?

Then why are you packing fudge?

Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.

Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! 

Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.

Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?

Tell me what you wrote about!

Just... play something else! God!

You suck as a best friend, Cartman!

to make it spin.

That's a little strange, isn't it?

Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-

No, he's not.

Yes, dude!

Dude, you did make a deal... 

Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!

No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.

Twenty hours!

H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.

I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 

Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.

No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.

Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 

Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.

No, this is exactly what we wanted.

But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?

...I don't know where I belong...

Dad!

We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!

Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!

Ye-hah!

Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?

Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-

Oh no! 

Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 

That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 

Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.

Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?

Over here, over here!

Dude, just stop thinking about it.

Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 

No, no, we've just gotta find better help.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.

It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 

Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.

For what?

Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!

I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.

They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.

Hey hey, stop reading that!

Dude, where's the money?

Because of aliens? 

Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?

Woof.

Just the news.

Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.

Who's the Boss?

Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 

Dude.

For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.

My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.

... I don't know.

Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?

Well, uh-what do you mean?

What is wrong with that guy?

Chef! End of the road! 

Uh oh, this isn't good.

I think we're good.

Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.

Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?

Aw crap!

Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 

Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 

Ahta. Ah, ahta!

Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 

Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!

Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 

Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 

Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?

Oh come on, people!

... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?

How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?

Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!

Well, I guess we learned our lesson.

Uh oh.

Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.

Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?

S- hold it a while, okay?

Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.

Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...

Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.

Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.

They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?

What's up dude?

Wait, it's not a real illness?

Awwww!

How do you know?

Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 

...and then we put them back in the tank.

Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.

Yeah, mung.

Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?

Stop. 

Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.

Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.

Yes?

What is it, Craig?

Visitors are real.

What???

I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.

What battlefield?!

Yeah. Yeah, there is.

This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.

Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!

You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.

Can we go now?

Come on, Dad! Get up!

We made a promise... to Jesus! 

We don't know.

Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!

I know, huh?

Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.

Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.

Oooh- hey, Kenny.

Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.

Let him out, dude. He's scared.

Get out of here!

We wish

Yeah... Or you. 

Dude, it's crowded in here.

No he doesn't!!

The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?

I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.

I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.

Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.

Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!

No ma'am.

We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...

Man, it's hot out here.

Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.

I hope so.

Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!

Hello?

Wow, this is a huge party.

No.

Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!

What? 

Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.

Yeah.

Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.

You found what?

No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 

Come on, you guys. 

I think I'm going to name it Gorak.

Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.

Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?

Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.

What is that?

That doesn't make sense! 

You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!

Not it! You lose, Kenny. 

We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?

So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!

Awww!

No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!

We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?

Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.

This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!

Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...

No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.

Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 

Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!

Sweet!

Yeah dude, it's just shit.

What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 

Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?

Fine, then you can come with me. 

Are you serious?

But he is-

What's that?

Superfatass?

Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?

Oh Jesus, here we go.

NO.

Owww.

Oooo. 

It is?

All right!

Dude, we have to go!

Hello?

Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!

Butters! 

You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 

Oh, thanks.

Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.

Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 

What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 

I'm voting.

Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??

Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.

Yeah, go on dude!

Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!

We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.

We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.

Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?

I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.

GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 

Dude, that kicks ass!

What who said?

Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.

Did you know your mom was from Jersey?

Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 

Hurry dude!

Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 

Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.

What's that?

Bleech!

Dude, Kenny!

Catch what?

We just wanna be junior detectives.

My friend, Gorak!

Kyle, don't be such a butthole!

That's my silly grampa. 

I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.

This is gonna be so awesome!

Over here! 

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Whoa. Dude, no way!

Less than 20 minutes?!

Jesus Christ, dude!

Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!

Dude, we need help from the British!

Hm.

I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.

Do I have to?

But can he still ride a bull?

We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!

A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.

Sure.

The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.

Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.

Super best friends?

Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!

Okay, let's go!

The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!

We don't get to go to Scotland?

Hey, that was easy!

For what?

Oh. 

Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.

Heard what?

You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.

I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.

Hey, what's up?

Two four nine all right, this is the place.

No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.

Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.

Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?

No no! We weren't gonna go there!

You do? 

My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.

Damnit Cartman, wha-?!

They, they had it! They freakin' had it!

Hey, be careful in there.

Dude, we're not killing your mom.

Yeah.

Well, you might as well let it go.

Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.

Aaah!

What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?

Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.

Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!

Hey! Mom!

My dad lets me watch cartoons.

Go America.

Oh no. No, no, no!

Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?

Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.

...so?

Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.

No.

God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,

You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!

What disease should we say?

Wow, cool!

I knew he'd turn up.

I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.

Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.

Okay I'll be your friend.

Why does it matter?!

It's what?

Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.

Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.

Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 

Yeah, we know better than to think that.

What, dude?

Sweet.

Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?

Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.

Yeah! He just got paroled!

No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?

Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-

What are you talking about?

Child Tracker?

Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.

Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 

Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?

Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 

We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.

Oh boy.

Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!

I haven't been sleeping so well.

We just need to borrow him, kid. 

See? My dad is the coolest after all.

Shut up, Cartman!

We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.

Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!

What?

That sounds like shit!

Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. 

Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.

I'll try

No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.

Yeah. Why?

Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!

This is not the time for that!

But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 

Nan da kore? 

Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.

Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!

What? How do you know she has a cat? 

Oh no!

Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.

You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.

Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?

You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!

Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!

He hits this switch- 

For one tooth?

Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 

What??

Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!

Oh shit, somebody's coming!

W-we weren't scared!

I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.

Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.

Yeah, stupid.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!

Dude! He bailed on us!

Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.

It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.

Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!

Oh, hey Butters.

Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.

Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!

But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.

What?!

All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 

Really?

What the hell is going on here?

Dad? Dad, we need to talk.

Dude!

Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!

Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?

Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.

Okay, good.

And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?

Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!

Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. 

I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.

Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.

Yeah?

What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?

I think I have a better idea.

So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.

Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!

He's like, some frozen guy.

Boy band?

And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 

We're in the alien ship.

Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!

Dude!

Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!

Oh no!

Aww... he was packing fudge!

But you-your face!

Yeah, I think he was. Wait.

Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.

Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.

Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.

Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 

Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.

Hello? Anybody in there? 

Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?

Sup? 

For what, dude?

I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.

Yuh, you guys okay. 

Wait, wait, ah I might need those.

See what?

It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 

Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!

Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.

Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?

Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 

Two dollars!

Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??

The gods will find us a way!

Where is he now?

Hey, we want our money back.

We're heroes!

That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!

Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?

Tell him we're busy.

Ow!

Not everybody pees in pools.

It fell; I'll try again.

I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.

To stop bullying.

Okay, grab the sled. 

This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.

Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.

Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.

Damn, dude, this place is huge! 

What are you talking about Chef?

Whatever, dude.

Kyle? 

Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.

You mean, like Kenny?

Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 

No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.

No you can't, you little ass-sucker!

I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.

Oh, neither.  It's my sister.

Who are you?

Who was that?

Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?

All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.

Aw crap! 

You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!

Jeez, they made that into a movie already?

Shut up, Cartman!

Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? 

Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!

All right, we just need one more person!

It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.

Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.

What?? What??

They took him on their ship.

Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 

Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.

He's back!

This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.

Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! 

No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!

Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.

Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.

Who?  Oh, shit.

Totally dude.

You guys! You guys! I figured it out!

Okay, let's get back to the room. 

Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?

Aw come on.

Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!

Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.

...Abe Lincoln?

Yeah.

Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 

Wugh! Two weeks of this!

What's that?

I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.

Tweek?

Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?

What?

Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.

No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 

Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.

Jimmy's funny, dude.

Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.

Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

No, you can't do that!

Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.

Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?

My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.

No, Dad-

Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.

I can't. I was banished for not voting.

Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.

Okay.

Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet

Yeah, screw that kid!

This place gives me the creeps.

No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 

Well, I guess.

NO!  I won't say anything, I promise! 

But Mr. Twig sucks.

Yahtzee. Sixes.

Wow, cool!

Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?

I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."

I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.

Well, let's dig 'er up! 

Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!

...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-

Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?

Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.

Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.

That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 

No, that's too extreme!

Having sex with women.

I can't believe it! It's all a scam!

Kyle?

Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.

I just, my dad was-

Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!

I know, but you don't tell him that!

Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 

That's it? That's how you did that trick?

Ugh God.

Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.

That's not what the Harrisons said.

What is that?

He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.

Dude!

Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.

What are these? They're Chinpokomon!

I said I have a bad itch.

So what do we do now?

Butters was missing?

Can I have a Pop Tart?

Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.

What?!

Yeah, right!

Talked?!

No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.

But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 

Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 

Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?

Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.

Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 

"Dare!"

Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?

Who the hell is that?

Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.

Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.

All right.

So? You can poo in the wilderness.

Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?

There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!

Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.

Aah! Run, dude, run!

Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 

Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?

Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?

Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!

Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.

Maybe they found him out.

I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?

No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.

No, he didn't!

Now what are we gonna do, Chef?

Kyle! No!

It was all planned out!

She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.

It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!

Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 

Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!

No, it isn't!

Yeah! Well, not this time!

Great. A lot of help you are, kid.

Over two hundred bucks.

I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls

And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.

Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?

Shut up, Pip.

Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?

Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.

Nonono, not yet. DAD!

Let me see your iPad, Cartman.

Ooooooo...

What?

All right, sorry guys. So where to now?

Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!

...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?

Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!

Wwhat do you mean?

Yeah.

Now what do we do?

Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 

We can start having fun again! 

Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?

"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 

'K.

Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!

What don't I understand?

Who are you people?

We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!

You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!

Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!

Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 

We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now

Hello?

Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.

I never said I was.

Butters!  Did you bring it?

Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?

What the hell are they gonna do to us?

Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.

Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?

This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.

Yeah, we did that!

I'll be back. 

It's the police!

There is what again? 

No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.

Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-

Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 

Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 

Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.

Well, dude, you better find out!

Dude!

The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.

They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.

This guy sucks! 

Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 

Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.

I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?

What?

How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!

Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.

You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.

Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.

What?

Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 

You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!

Uh oh.

Help ...him?

What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!

Things seem pretty quiet.

YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!

I just opened an account.

Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.

...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!

Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!

But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.

Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.

Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.

Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.

Fine.

We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 

Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 

Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?

How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.

Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.

What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.

He's remembering.

Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!

Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.

...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.

Oh God-damnit!

...nine, eight...

Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.

What's the problem?

Okay we got it! We got it! 

Who are you?

Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.

Here they are.

Come on, everybody be people now

W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 

What?

God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!

It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!

There it is! American Idol contestants!

Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!

Sshh! 

Well... Well what do we do?

Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!

Dude, he's really sick. 

What word could we make up?

Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.

Hellafun

Easy.

Damn it!

He's what?? 

Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?

I'll kill you!

D'you think that's enough?

We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.

Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 

All right, I'm going now. 

Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.

Hang on guys!

He wanted money?

I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.

I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

Hm, that sounds pretty good.

I can't believe they actually said it. 

Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.

Really? That's great.

You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!

Oh, no.

You're not gonna get away with this! 

Fine!

You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?

Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.

So what is the secret of Easter?

What is that?!

I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-

But Dad-

We got invited too, fatass!

Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.

Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.

You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!

Confession box is over there! 

Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? 

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-

Visitors!

Yeah, I guess so. 

No, I'm on the Japanese side.

Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!

Dude, Chef has lost it.

You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?

You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.

Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.

Aw dude, I need to go to bed.

Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!

What the hell just happened?

Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns

Huh? But you just got dumped

I have to give him half my stuff?

He's losing weight. 

Yeah dude, not cool.

Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.

I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?

Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! 

Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!

Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?

Well WHAT, Cartman?

Oh. 

Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-

You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!

What?!

He's doomed.

So, what are you and Wendy doing?

Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.

Come on, let's go get to the plane. 

That's stupid, Cartman.

But I have to know for sure. 

Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! 

Whoa, he built a wicker basket

I wasn't talking about spaghetti. 

Chef!! 

We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!

Heheheh hehehe...

Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!

I have to do this, okay? I have to!

Kyle, what were you thinking?

Man...

A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.

Oh my God, he killed Kenny.

Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.

Who?

Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-

Oooo.

We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!

And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.

Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.

So how did it go last night? 

I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.

Angry Clit Spasm

I know, right?! 

We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?

Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.

Dad?

Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.

There's nothing here, Kyle. 

Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!

Do you feel anything?

Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.

Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.

That's not very imaginative.

What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?

What?

Dude, is he here every year like this?

Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!

No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.

Do you think they should change the flag?

Alright, where's Clyde.

No, dad! No!

He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?

You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!

I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!

Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.

A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.

You buying school lunch today?

Here. Wu-we don't want it.

NO.

Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 

How?!

Well, what do you mean?

You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.

Admit it was our fault?

You guys, you guys!

Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 

Oh hey Kyle.

Dude, we totally got let out of school.

I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me. 

Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?

Fine! 

Stop it.

Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!

Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.

Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.

No.

No i wouldn't.

Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 

Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?

Okay.

He is in there.

What, you mean it?

You just did that to everybody in class!

It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.

Super. See you there. 

Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.

So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?

Did Kyle know about this?!

What do you want from me, dude?!

It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.

It's... it's the greatest show of all time.

Dude!

It's uh, Marsh. 

His a-miracles?

Maybe we were wrong about the clue.

I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.

But he's funny.

Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 

Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.

...Asshole. 

What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?

Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!

Dude. You're such a grandpa.

Our Cartman would never say anything like that.

If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!

Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!

Dude, you've got herpes on your face!

We busted you!

What?

But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!

So what do you suggest?

(Sick, dude!)

Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!

Wow!

Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 

It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!

Chef, we're intolerant. 

Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.

Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.

What are you doing here?

Kenny woulda done it. 

I'm going too. 

Indy! 

Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.

...I don't believe it.

Huh, that's a bitch.

So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?

Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.

We're building a clubhouse.

We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.

Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!

No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.

Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.

Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 

What do we want?

Dude, what happened?? 

Wow cool.

Fuck off, Dad. 

Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!

On a boat! That wasn't mine!

Well, of course your parents said you can't go!

Well you have to convince them they are real!

Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.

But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!

Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.

No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 

They're not together anymore, dude.

So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.

This late?

Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.

When did we do dibs for it?

...That makes perfect sense, Butters.

Yeah.

Dude! Did you get 'em?

It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.

That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!

Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.

Where?!

Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?

Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.

We we speak English!

I don't... I don't know.

I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!

All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 

Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.

Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.

Dad, get off our teamspeak line!

DAD!

Where am I supposed to get a gun?

You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 

One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.

Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.

Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 

Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 

I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!

Fifteen bucks?!

I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 

Sweet.

What?

I like small businesses.

What?

I'm working on it!

I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 

Go! Run run run! 

Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 

Dude, this is my room!

We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!

Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 

No- dude, I told you I can't do that.

Whoa! Who are you?

Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?

Dude, we don't have any musical talent.

What??

Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.

What the hell are you doing?!

How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!

Lubricated Titty Burgers.

My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 

Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 

Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!

You'd better not be lying, Kenny. 

Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.

Yeah, this is not gonna work.

No!  A dead body.

Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.

Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.

You'd better shut up, Craig.

...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 

Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.

Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.

So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?

No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!

So now we are in th real world.

Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!

Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 

...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.

Kenny?

Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 

Okay, okay.

Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?

Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 

We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!

Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.

Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.

Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!

...He's got us there, dude. 

Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.

Hey, where's Cartman?

Aw dude, I clocked you!

Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!

Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.

Jesus, Cartman!

Bluuuuch! 

Tralalalala

Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.

All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!

How?

Butters!

We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?

All right, the county fair's still open! 

No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.

Yeah.

Immortal.

All right, that's three!

What are you talking about?

I'm not voting!

It's like... they know. 

Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?

NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.

I think I understand.

But you're his sparring partner, Chef.

All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 

They're back!

Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.

Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.

I thought you guys were pirates in a war!

Yeah, that'd be cool.

Oh my God...

Yeah. Or, we could not.

The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.

What?

What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.

What?

No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.

Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up! 

Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.

Don't you see, Kyle?

Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!

Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.

Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 

Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program? 

Whoa!

Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!

Just drink the pee, Kyle.

How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?

Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.

It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?

Cartman?!

All right. 

Yeah, come on guys, this is war! 

Yup.

Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.

Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??

Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.

Oh, no, no, no no no no.

Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!

They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.

But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!

Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.

Chef, but-

Bitch. Bitch.

Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!

Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!

Go where?

There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 

…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.

The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.

Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.

No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?

Oh yeah.

Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!

What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?

I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 

If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?

Whoa, dude, this is a school? 

Wait, whattaya mean no?

Yes!

He'd better!

What do we want?

Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.

You're gonna be all right.

Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!

to make it spin.

Oh no, what now?

DVD? We don't own a DVD player.

It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.

Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
