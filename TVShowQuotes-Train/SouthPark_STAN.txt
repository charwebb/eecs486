Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.

No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?

You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 

Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.

...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.

Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?

Sso?

...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!

And it's okay to be gay! 

No.

Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?

Well, I guess.

Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.

Yeah. Why?

God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...

Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?

It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.

Round one is over. We made it. 

Hello?

You're gonna have to tell him, dude.

Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 

Dude! Visitors!

Uh huh, Stan Marsh.

It's uh, Marsh. 

I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!

What? How do you know?

Sparky! Sparky!

Yeah, and then what?

Yeah, dude, that's gross.

Stupid third grader!

Jesus Christ!

Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 

But why do I have to leave?

That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!

But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!

It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 

Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.

How can they even call that a movie?

Where are we supposed to go?

It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!

Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.

We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 

Should I try them?

What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!

Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.

Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 

Come on, let's get it a try. 

Kyle, don't be such a butthole!

What are you talking about, dude?

That was a good one.

No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.

Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?

Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?

Oh.

This spot looks good. 

'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 

Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.

Nothing, just... playing.

Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.

All right!

Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 

Some, kids from Orange County.

No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 

Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!

Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!

Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?

I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.

No!

Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.

No.

Wendy?

A note?

The fish!  But-.

Sick, dude.

Where's Gobbles, Timmy?

No!

Dude, we got GameSphere.

Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!

Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.

What?

He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.

Wow!

At least I'm not a little pigfucker!

We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!

No, he didn't!

Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.

You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.

We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.

What?

…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.

What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.

What's a Hitler?

This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!

Oh God, don't care, don't care.

Well... Well what do we do?

Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.

Dude, we have to go!

Why oh oh?

Okay.

Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.

And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!

The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 

I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?

It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.

Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.

Costumes? 

Where's Gorak??

Then you're not a fag.

Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 

Just, just a little.

Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.

Naw, I'm with Wendy.

Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?

Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!

Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?

All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!

'bout what?

I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me. 

Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

Then you're a stupid douche

Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.

Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.

What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?

Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.

Dude, what's the big deal?

It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?

Oh no, he didn't.

Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!

Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.

Come on, fatass, we have to go!

Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?

Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.

Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.

But we need you!

Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.

All right.

We busted you!

Jesus, Jesus!

Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!

Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!

What are you doing here?

Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.

No. Dad. Please don't do this!

Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.

Boo!

How should we split up?

I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.

How expensive?

Hey look! There's a taxi! 

We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?

What?

Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.

It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!

Yeah, right!

Gee, thanks!

Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 

Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 

Wait a minute! I've got it. 

But you're his sparring partner, Chef.

Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 

What the hell? 

How'd he do that??

Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.

Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 

Easy.

Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?

I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 

Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.

Come on, people. Come on, people now. 

Yeah I'm ready!

How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!

No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.

'Cause I need to know why she broke up.

Um, deny it?

What? Hey! 

Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.

How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.

We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?

Please, take us to them! Please!

What is it?

Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!

Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.

Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?

Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 

I'll try

What do we do???

Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?

Dude!

Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.

Bad.

Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"

Wait, wha-what?

Aw- awww!

So wait, did we do good?

...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!

They both look the same. 

I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.

But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.

Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?

Kyle, you can't kill yourself!

I have no idea.

Kyle! You have to stop them!

When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.

Got it.

Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.

Yes.

You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.

Shhh! Here comes Cartman.

...What?

Cartman?

Dude, we never thought you were cool.

Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.

All right!

What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.

I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!

That's so gross.

Shut up, Cartman!

All right. Let's work it!  What the...?

We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.

Huh?

This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!

Sparky'll kick his ass.

I guess.

God damnit, that fat piece of shit!

Kyle, you gotta see!! 

...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.

1  2.

One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.

Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!

Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.

That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?

I know we can lose if we try.

So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.

Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!

Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 

Dude, that seems kind of... weird.

Kyle!

Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.

...they've killed Kenny!

He's fakin'!

Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!

Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.

What?

Chef, we're leaving.

Hey Kenny.

Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.

Okay it says I'm at your farm.

I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.

What?

Yeah!

Wow, that sucks, dude.

Sick, shut up dude. 

Stop, you fucking lunatic! 

I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.

All right, that's three!

It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.

Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.

No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-

Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 

Whoa.

Yay.

That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.

He'll do it, dude.

Dude, we need you.

Kenny?

I'm me from the past?

A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.

My dad lets me watch cartoons.

I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!

Maybe they couldn't get out!

They've all been lying to us this whole time!

Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 

I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!

Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.

Whoa, that was cool! 

Hey look, Kenny's not dead.

Kyle, maybe this is for real.

That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.

Dude, I really don't care. 

Dude!

Dude. Shut up, Cartman.

This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 

Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.

He looks like a guy.

Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!

I think he might've run away.

Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.

I don't. She's totally lame. 

Dad, I was just a--

Oh, boy. You've done it now.

Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 

Dad, where's our Bible?

We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!

What the hell are they gonna do to us?

Wait. Where's my Dad?

Uh huh.

Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.

Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!

No.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

That's such a great paper! 

Guinea pigs?

How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?

This place gives me the creeps.

Don't you see, Kyle?

Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.

Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.

What?!

The arcade?

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 

No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 

He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?

You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!

You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 

Yeah, awesome!

Oogh.

Dad, oh my God!

All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.

Oh no, what now?

Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-

Goddamnit. 

Dad!

...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.

Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.

Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.

We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 

You what?!

I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.

Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?

Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.

It might be a way out, Craig!

Hormones? 

Yeah.

Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.

They look fine to me. 

Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.

Dad, this is stupid.

Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!

We got it.

Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.

What the hell is that?

Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!

Oh, yeah. Eeww.

Whoa, cool! 

What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!

Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?

All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,

Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.

That's amazing!

Something I should have done a long time ago. 

Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.

Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 

Well, dude, you better find out!

I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.

Dare. 

Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!

Ho-o-oh.

No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.

Yeah, it's all set.

Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.

I don't know. 

Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.

If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?

What?

Tie? Well, what does that mean?

Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.

Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!

Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.

A B.J.?

I'm not playing.

Okaaay. 

Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 

Why?

Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?

Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 

Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!

"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".

Mr. Mackey!

So, what now?

Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.

Who's the Coon?

Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!

I'll kick your ass, Kyle!

Over?  Jesus...

Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?

What?!

It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.

Hey future self.

Don't kill Kenny!

Who was that?

It is?

Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 

Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!

Wow, really?!

Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?

Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.

Where do handicapped people go when they die?

Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 

Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 

Dude, what are you doing?

Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?

Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 

Grandpa.

Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!

Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg

Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.

Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! 

Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.

Does this mean we don't have school all week?

It was just decimation.

Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.

Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!

Not it! You lose, Kenny. 

Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.

That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.

Craig, Token, get the slings ready. 

Vince McMahon is coming to see us?

Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 

Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?

Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.

Oh shit, somebody's coming!

U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.

Yeah, go Broncos.

This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!

He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 

Bleech!

No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!

Here he comes.

Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!

Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.

Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?

You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!

No??

Let's head over this way, guys.

Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?

I, I can't.

Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.

Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!

Wow cool.

Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 

Oooh?

Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.

My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?

Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.

Yes!

Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!

Man, this condom's driving me crazy.

Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.

Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 

Cartman, come on!

Craig, are we still clear?

Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?

I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!

Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 

What the hell was that?

Somebody in this class?

Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.

Yeah.

Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.

Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?

Dad, you're a geologist!

Hey Gary.

Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.

All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?

How are you feeling?

I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 

Jesus Christ! 

Come on, dude! 

We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!

Oh, he's fine, dude.

What don't I understand?

...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!

Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.

Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."

Two hundred? Million?

Okay, let's go!

We worked our asses off to compete with that?!

Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?

Aw shit, it's him again.

What titties?

Yeah, golf is stupid again. 

Dude!

Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.

This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!

Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?

' G'oh?

I'm not voting! 

I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.

Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.

This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.

Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-

Go America.

...Go away.

Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.

All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.

No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 

AAAAAAAA!

So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.

Pass it to me, Cartman?

Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 

I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.

My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.

That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!

I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!

Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. 

Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?

Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!

No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?

Hooray! 

Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.

Should we tell him the truth?

Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?

It's Saturday.

Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!

Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!

But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.

Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 

We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!

We made it!

Dude, what the hell is your problem?!

Hey dude.

No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.

I don't?

It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.

My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.

Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.

I know. He's here.

That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 

Yeah, sure, what about it?

This doesn't look very safe.

Where'd you get that?

Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? 

What is that?

I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.

I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?

What kind of help?

Uuuuhh.

We need to talk.

NO!  I won't say anything, I promise! 

No, you don't!

Wow! So you'll help him?

Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 

One?

Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?

I can't. I'm busy.

I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.

Aw, shit.

Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.

Dude, just stop thinking about it.

Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.

Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.

Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!

Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 

We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?

Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.

Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 

Because of aliens? 

Oh

Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!

Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 

I like the PS4's controller better.

That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.

Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!

I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.

Dude, the hell just happen?

How many days left in summer?

What??

You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 

You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!

Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?

Mr. Garrison, stop!

You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 

But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-

Huh?

Child Tracker?

Aargh! 

Just drink the pee, Kyle.

Dad? Dad!

Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.

Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!

Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!

We've got to learn how to do that, dude!

Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 

That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 

Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!

Two four nine all right, this is the place.

What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.

Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!

Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.

We're not gonna make it! 

Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.

God-damn!

Oh, hi, Wendy.

Is that an M&M?

Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!

They're in London too?

Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.

And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.

Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 

Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.

No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.

I have no idea...

Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 

Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.

I hope so.

No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.

What the hell are you doing, Cartman?

We're doing it!

Really, what about?

I'm gonna go on the slides.

Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!

People from the future. Right, got it.

Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.

Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-

That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.

But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!

I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.

Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.

Come on, guys. 

Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.

Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.

Let's go! 

Huh.

We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!

No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!

Hey, that's what I wrote about!

Whoa! Who are you?

What, dude?

Me??

How do you know?

Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?

You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!

Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 

Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.

This is sweet, huh Kenny? 

I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?

Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?

So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?

Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 

...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 

Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!

I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.

No, I never have.

Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.

Yeah.

Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?

Underpants?

Oh dude! Oh Jesus!

Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.

I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 

Dude, it's crowded in here.

Dude, we can't do that

Okay, fine. 

You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!

No, no, it's not that.

What are you guys doing?

Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!

What, you mean, Kyle?

Dude, you really are sick, huh?

Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!

Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.

Sure, for what?

Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-

Okay, it's clear. 

Hey, who's that fat chick?

Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!

Okay.

Okay, go. 

You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?

What the hell is he doing?

Chef, but-

Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.

Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.

Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!

What do you mean?

Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 

I'll try

"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"

Ow!

What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 

They what?!

Shut up, Cartman!

He really wants those dolls.

I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!

I really like that guy.

Wow! 

...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.

No!

Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.

He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.

The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.

Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.

To the bathroom?

No problems at all!

That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids

We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?

What?

We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!

Would you mind stepping back a little?

Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.

Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?

We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.

Whoa!

I'll try again.

It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.

No??

Plastic pumpkin pails...

Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?

HA, I blew your head off!

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!

Cool!

Well alright. 

Dude, he's wasted.

Yhh, yeah, the first grader?

No way, dude! Don't be silly.

Let's just go, Let's just go! 

Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?

Hey.

What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 

I know!

Dude, weak!

Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!

We love

Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!

My locker?

Dude, where's the money?

Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.

... I'm eight!

Yeah, this is not gonna work.

You do?

I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-

Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 

What's "lose bowel control?"

Yeah! He just got paroled!

Oh yeah.

You, you do? How?

Uuugh!

Shut up, fatass! 

Aliens?

Shut up Kyle!

It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.

You did throw it away, Cartman.

Ah, damn it, I can't do it!

Day five. I made it!  Hello?

Dude, where have you been?

Where to now, Chef?

Oh Jesus, can we just practice?

Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.

No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.

What??

Friend. Ahta.

No- dude, I told you I can't do that.

Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!

What??

Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.

Of course!

AAH. 

What?!

Run for it!

Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.

I thought I was supposed to!

No!

Where's you get the balls from?

Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.

Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?

You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!

All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!

We knew he wouldn't make it.

Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.

Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.

I knew he'd turn up.

You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.

Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!

This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.

We go get the doll ourselves.

Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 

Yahtzee.

No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.

Oh, brother.

What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.

W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?

Ugh God.

What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.

The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!

Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.

Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 

Neither did I!

He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 

Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 

Whoa, dude! 

No!

Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.

Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.

You dumbass, Cartman!

Shut up, Pip.

No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!

Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?

I gotta get home for dinner.

Cartman!

Dude, I think I just saw a rat!

Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.

He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.

Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!

Hello, are you Meat Loaf?

Hey, can I join in? 

Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.

What was that?

Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!

Stop that rat! 

Uh. Hi.

You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.

Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.

Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.

Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!

What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!

We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!

Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.

Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?

Aw- awwww!

Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 

Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.

No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.

Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.

We're in the alien ship.

Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.

...Abe Lincoln?

Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.

I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!

Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 

Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?

Yeah!

Huh, that's a bitch.

Hey!  Wait a minute!

Play the Red Wings?

Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!

No way!

Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.

Ah, dude, you don't say that.

I... said it would really bum them out.

Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.

I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.

No he doesn't!!

It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.

Yuh, you guys okay. 

Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.

Wow!

What are they talking about?

Christmas Poo?

We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.

It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.

No, dude, I feel worse!

Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.

I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.

Really?

All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.

Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?

Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.

I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.

Hey, what's this? 

Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 

Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 

Oh.

Oh my God... They killed Chef.

Oh no.

This can't get any worse. 

Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.

What's that?

Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.

Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.

Yeah.

We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!

Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.

Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.

Dude, I don't know!

Is the whole government in on this?

God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!

Ah, shit.

What?? 

I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?

It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!

Huh, excuse me?

Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!

You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!

Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!

Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?

See? Now we can hold out for weeks!

I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.

It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!

Yeah!

Man, this sucks!

No! I never cut if off!

Alright, let's go.

...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-

They've already accomplished so much.

I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.

Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.

Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!

Yeah, but why?

I knew we could do it!

Oh.

I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.

"Dare!"

(Okay, okay, just go away!) 

We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.

Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.

Tolerance camp?

I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.

Huh? Why?

Where are you going?

Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?

People are saying that? 

Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.

Uh, yyeah.

What's going on?

What the hell's going on?!

...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.

Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.

No you don't, fatass!

Aw, come, on dude! This is history.

Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.

Okay, let's try it again. Hup!

Dad!

Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.

Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?

Hey! Mom!

Chef! End of the road! 

No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.

Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?

Let's see what's in there.

Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.

Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.

Oh, hey Dad.

Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!

Hellafun

We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!

Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.

Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!

But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?

Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.

Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.

That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.

Who?  Oh, shit.

"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!

No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac

What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!

Kicked out? Oh no!

Whoa!

Uh huh...

Islam??

I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!

Here! 

What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 

Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.

Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.

Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.

What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 

Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!

Wow, really? 

He can't hold it in forever.

I'll try again.

Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.

...Oh-kay.

Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.

We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 

Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 

What?

NO.

He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 

She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.

That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!

Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--

Cartman, you stupid asshole! 

Holy shi-  poop.

Well, I can hardly wait.

We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!

Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?

Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.

It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 

It... it was right here.

Right, so, why do we color eggs? 

Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?

Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?

Well dude, somebody has got to go down!

Ye-hah!

Yes, you can. What's stopping you?

Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.

What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!

You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.

Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 

No, dude, it was totally fine.

Man! That sucked, getting searched. 

I'll be back. 

Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.

No, he's not.

Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! 

Yeah, that'd be cool.

I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.

Puff Daddy?

Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?

My room? Why?

And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.

No, we have to return it! 

I guess.

Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?

Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!

You found what?

Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.

Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...

What?

Me?

Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?

Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns

Dude!

Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 

We're here.

involves needing scissors and glue!

Are you serious??

Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?

So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!

Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.

Stan. Marsh.

'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!

'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?

...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-

Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?

Well, what can we do about it?

You're a sinner!

Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 

Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!

What's he want?

Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.

Aw, dammit!

We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!

Uuh. Thanks.

We can start having fun again! 

Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.

Yeah.

Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!

Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 

What?

Heard what?

...Yes, I'm serial.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.

Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.

I'm totally depressed.

Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.

I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.

It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.

Oh Jesus!

Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?

Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.

My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.

Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?

Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.

Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?

What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?

Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.

What??

So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.

Cartman!

When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!

Oh my God.

(Sick, dude!)

Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.

Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?

All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 

Oh, now she figures it out.

Damn, dude. 

Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'

To the sewer, dude.

They're shooting at us.

We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.

Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 

...So take it with you!

What is that?

What?!

Kenny?!  What's he say?

Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.

Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!

No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 

Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.

Aw crap!

Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?

What?

Dude. That movie sucked.

Bleech!

...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.

Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!

We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.

Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.

Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?

No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 

Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!

Denver? 

Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?

I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 

All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I

Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!

Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.

What?

Jesus!

"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 

Alright, we made it!

Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?

Dude, let's play Fireman.

That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.

Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?

What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! 

Where the hell have you guys been?!

What? What's he doing?

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.

Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?

All right, I'm going now. 

Kyle? Kyle!

That's not cool!

Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting! 

Two hours.

A six-layer burrito?

We made it!

Okay, let's try this. 

Come on dude, it's pretty funny.

Oh yeah, we can't!

...What?

Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 

Now what are we gonna do, Chef?

Boy, do we!

Huh?

I found him, I'm rescuing him! 

Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.

It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!

Hey, I didn't throw up.

Marry him?

Stay gold. 

Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.

No. I didn't, but-

So throw it away.

...Thank you.

What ride?

Aw, hell!

Sound pretty typical to me.

We do what we can, sir.

You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.

Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.

I can't. 

Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.

There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!

Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!

Yeah, haha.

Wow, dude.

You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-

Who's that?

No, I think you oughta.

Jesus Christ!!!

No, my dad doesn't drink.

Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.

What's the matter with you?

Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??

You like it?

...O-kay.

Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.

That's probably okay if you spread it out.

Dad, where's the phone book?

We're losing men fast out here! 

...Kenny would have done it.

Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.

Oh Jesus Christ! 

No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!

What's this?

That's right! 

Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.

Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.

I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!

Wendy, why is it such a big deal?

I'm working on it!

What? That's it?

Hey, how about this little guy?

Butters?

... Really?

Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?

Knew what?

What? 

Yes?

Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.

I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.

Oh I'm ready!

My mom won't let us. 

I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!

Jesus Christ.

Yeah, me too.

Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.

You can't just leave me here alone.

So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 

I didn't know.

Heh, heh.  Sorry.

Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?

Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.

Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.

We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!

Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.

Run for your life, dude! 

A wall toilet for peeing in.

Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.

This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.

I always wondered if that would work.

I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.

Oh. 

We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. 

I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.

Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.

Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.

And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,

Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.

Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.

Huh?

Dad, we're gonna crash!

Hey, look, Craig just walked in. 

Oh, Goddammit! 

Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 

Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 

Oh. Uh-I don't know.

No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.

Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?

Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.

All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 

Whoa duude!

I have to do this, okay? I have to!

Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 

You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?

Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--

Okay, it's clear. Come on! 

I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.

There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 

No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?

Butters, Goddammit.

Help!

No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 

Taser... 

Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?

All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.

Damnit!

What the hell is wrong with everybody?

Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?

Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!

Uh-eally? Uh you think so?

Yes, Grandpa.

Get to the stage! 

Butters, go on!

He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."

A what?

Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?

Yeah, it was huge.

How?

I'm not playing, I'm coaching.

Aw Jesus...

Oooo. 

Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?

It will have to do. We're not getting closer.

Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-

All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!

Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.

If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?

No.

That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.

And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?

Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.

Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.

Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?

This is the smartest business venture ever. 

Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?

All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 

It's time for what?

That sounds pretty fun.

What's the Black Death, Chef?

Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.

...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?

Then let's go, dude! 

And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!

Come on, everybody be people now

SWEET!

Can I have a Pop Tart?

Going away party? What do you mean?

What the hell do you want from me?! 

Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 

...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.

Crap!

Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!

I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 

Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.

I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!

No thanks.

We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!

Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 

Smell what?

Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!

The gods will find us a way!

It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.

Oh no! No nononononono!

Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?

Hey, Chef.

Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.

Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?

Yeah, get with the times, dude. 

Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?

Dad!

Do you think he can ride the bull?

Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!

Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!

Mr. Hankey? 

Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!

But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.

Thanks a lot.

Yes it is!

What?

Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.

Come on, guys! 

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

We're making faces at sick people.

Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 

That was awesome!

Oh, thank God.

Trick or treat.

Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?

No you can't, you little ass-sucker!

So how do we do that?

As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 

Dad they aren't here for that.

Wha? 

I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 

Cartman?

(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!

Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.

Don't put this all on me, Kyle!

You shut up,  gaywad!

Yeah, but, mom!

Your what?

Hey there, little guy.

Oh that's good.

What?

And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!

But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.

Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?

Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.

I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?

All right, let's get the hell out of here! 

You do?

It's the police!

Bluuuch 

COME ON LET'S GO! 

Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!

Uh, it... sucks ass.

I already lost all my baby teeth.

Really? That'd be sweet.

Kyle. Kyle, wake up.

Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 

Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 

Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.

Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?

Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?

But you all thought our name was sweet.

When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.

Jesus Christ, dude! 

Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.

God dammit!

...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.

Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??

What does it want?

No, Dad, NO.

Oh no...

They're not gonna kill us.

Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.

Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.

Headgear?  What headgear?

Hey yeah! 

Dude, the road is always snowy.

How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!

Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!

Dad? 

Well, of course your parents said you can't go!

We have come to reclaim the one tape! 

Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?

One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 

Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...

Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!

Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?

And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 

So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?

No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 

How'd you get that on your phone?

Fine.

...Farmers in where?

Butters!

My parents will never let me keep a goat

Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?

Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.

Yeah.

Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 

Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?

Wh-what could it be? 

Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!

Dude.

Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.

Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.

Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.

Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.

Confession box is over there! 

Go Wing! 

All right, fine. 

Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.

Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.

They have nowhere else to go.  Please?

We told you dude.

Wuh, that smells. 

Come on, dude. Hurry.

You guys! You guys! I figured it out!

What'd they say?

Wendy!

Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.

So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?

Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.

The Imagination song?

It's what?

I like small businesses.

Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.

You woke him up! 

No.

Please, ih ih, it won't take long.

We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.

Three million dollars?

...What?

I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 

I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.

The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 

Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!

No! We won't let you destroy our town!

All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.

You must know what I'm talking about.

You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?

Yeah.

Wow! Count me in!

Hey, you guys came back!

We have to find a way out! 

Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?

When do we want it?

I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 

Come on Cartman, fart!

It was the fish! 

So?

Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!

Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?

Aw, do we have to?

Yeah.

I don't believe it.

I'll kill you!

...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!

Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 

Hurry up, stupid parachute!

The lion cubs!

Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 

Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.

I don't know,  I just like it.

Because we wanna see Kenny again. 

Yeah! Well, not this time!

What who said?

Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 

Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?

Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?

Go away! Shoo! 

Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.

Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!

I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.

Really?

I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.

Huh?

Come on, angry mob! 

I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"

What are you talking about, Cartman?!

Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.

That isn't funny, Cartman.

Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!

Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?

It fell;

Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.

We're on the case.

Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 

Dude! 

Dude, we need help from the British!

Mom, go look outside.

Jesus Christ, dude!

Bitch.

Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.

It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.

There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 

I'll get it. 

Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.

Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!

Dude, wanna do some math problems?

Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!

Hoh, whatever! 

N-no?

But it's super-cool!

Oooo.

They, they had it! They freakin' had it!

What?

I feel like total shit.

Dad, how did you get that?!

Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?

Uh-oh.

Awww what?!

What?

See ya, Dad!

...What?!

What? 

That seems kind of... weird.

Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.

Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.

...Yeah.

I'm going home.

Choirs suck.

You're gonna be all right.

Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 

I'll pay you back for it, okay?!

What the hell does that mean?

Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?

Good!

Kenny woulda done it. 

Who is that?

Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.

Nice speech, nerdo.

I dunno.

That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!

What?

Let them pass!  

We're not rednecks!

I'll try again.

I don't know.

We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!

Wendy, did you hear about last night?

Do what?

I know, but you don't tell him that!

Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?

Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.

What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!

Goddamnit... 

Can we go now?

Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.

What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.

Yeah it's different, Mom!

Dude, that's my dad!

Yuh.

You dumbass, Cartman!

Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 

Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.

Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.

Thank God. 

Wow, it sucks he has to leave.

to make it spin.

Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!

You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.

That isn't it at all. 

Ready? 1-2-3-4. 

Uh oh.

He's lying. 

No, no, no, no, we want our money back.

Yeah dude. It's really serious.

Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.

What the hell are we gonna do??

You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?

It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.

I guess... I guess you're right. 

It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.

Who the hell is that?

Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?

We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.

Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.

Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.

Yeah, at least one-fourth.

Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?

Dude, I don't even know who that is.

Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 

Uh what do I have to do?

Up yours, evil twin! 

Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.

Morning!

Ow!

Uh that sounds like shit too.

Oh, son of a bitch!

You did? 

They're coming!

Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?

Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.

Well there could still be a god.

Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.

All right, we just need one more person!

Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 

Dude, he's really sick. 

Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?

What's no big deal?

God damn it.

You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?

No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.

You're on!

Help!

Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?

I- 

Mom!

You speak English.

I don't think so.

I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.

Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.

No. I broke the dam.

Okay.

Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!

What gnomes?

Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?

You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!

The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!

The police?

Not... all the time.

Mom, I'm 10 years old now.

We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!

Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??

He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.

Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.

Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!

My friend, Gorak!

Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?

You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!

Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! 

No, we don't wanna do anything.

Oh.

You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!

All right, come on, guys. 

That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!

Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!

We shot all those videos and sent them in.

Oh my God! Dr. Adams!

Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.

Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.

Uh, come on, let's go. 

Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.

Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.

Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!

These guys are pretty good.

Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.

Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 

Blaaa-lalalalalalala.

Pretty good.

Okay, this is everything, mom. 

Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!

No, you just lost it all!

Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.

Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!

Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.

Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.

These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!

Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?

I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 

Oh, God, it's horrible! 

We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.

No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!

Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.

Oh, dude, we finished level 50!

Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!

'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.

What time is it?!

Now we'll never know where that pet store is!

Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 

Aaah!

... I don't know.

Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.

Do you think they should change the flag?

No.

No, no, we didn't--

Sorry.

We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 

Can you tell us where "that" is, please?

Tomorrow?

Dude!

Butters, you're the star of the video!

It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.

Aw dude, I need to go to bed.

This is not the time for that!

What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 

This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.

Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!

Dude, Chef has lost it.

We wish

You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.

Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!

So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.

We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.

Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!

What?

Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!

The 2001 Okama GameSphere?

Ohmigod, look! 

Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.

Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.

Got what all figured out?

Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 

Alright! 

What the hell is that? 

...I have no idea.

Damnit! 

Oh,. God. 

Oh boy.

So I can return it to a bank?

Uh, hey Dad.

Yeah, screw that kid!

No, my parents are.

Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.

Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 

What is it, Cartmam? 

Hey, Bill Cosby.

Yeah, Cartman told us.

What do you want from me, dude?!

I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 

Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!

Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.

I'm voting.

Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.

Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.

We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?

Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.

Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!

Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?

Yeah I know.

Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!

Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!

One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.

Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.

Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!

I just want everything to go back to the way it was.

It's genius.

Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.

All right, so you're sure he can dance?

Wow. 

Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.

Jimmy didn't stop them!

It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?

"We wish you a m- Merry"

Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.

Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.

Alright, here we go.

But they raped Indiana Jones!

They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.

Oh boy.  Bleech! 

Oh.

I take it back!

Oh, not Tweek.

Oh my God!

That's Cartman.

Bubye, Fartboy.

I haven't been sleeping so well.

You guys... need... anything? 

I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.

Can we go, please?

No.

Wow. Hi, Wendy.

Praise Christ.

My Internet's not working either.

"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!

Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?

Right on.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Two dollars!

Oh fuck you!

Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.

What?!

Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.

Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.

Hwat??

Dude, what happened?

I told you that would work!

Our... scause?

But mom, my teacher will-

Oh my God, that means...

Oh, brother! 

Right. 

Whoa!

D'you think that's enough?

Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 

Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.

Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.

Huh?

I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.

Good call.

You scram! We were here first!

Maybe there's another way out of here.

Oh my God.

...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?

I'll throw in five.

Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?

Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.

You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 

Wow!

Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!

Oh, man, that's terrible.

Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?

I think we have to signal them somehow.

You guys, we just wanna know if you-

What's that?

I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.

An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.

Hello?

Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?

Mom!

Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?

I'm getting on it first.

How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?

I am ready.

Kyle, look! It's them.

Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 

Good. How are you?

I donnow, just keep rolling.

Trick or treat.

Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.

Son of a bitch! 

Oh no! 

I just wanna do my homework!

Yeah! Here's one. 

Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.

Sleds are for guys.

You're a dick!

I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 

I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.

Huh?

Kiss my ass!

Dude, what's your little brother doing here?

What do you mean?

Hang on guys!

Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!

Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Dude!

Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 

Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 

Cartman, why are you doing this?

No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.

You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 

Yeah!

They took him on their ship.

...WHAT??

What's this? 

Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!

What, you mean it?

I said I have a bad itch.

Uh oh, this isn't good.

Dude, stop it.

Oh man, I feel like a total choad.

NO! 

What?? What??

Dude, are these all your toys?

Do you remember what pet store?

Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!

What? 

What the hell do you think you're doing?!

There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.

After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?

Yeah dude, not cool.

Awww..!

I wonder if it's all a western?

Yeah, they need to shut it off.

You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!

Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!

Oh.  Aaah! Snake!

Okay, we will.

Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!

What's mean about it?

Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!

Twenty hours!

Kyle! Kyle, don't!

Hey, yeah! 

And there's no score? No crowds?

Are we homophobes now?

Kyle, calm down.

Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 

Action!

Go, go, ruuun! 

We made it.

What's that?

You like... how they smell? How they taste?

No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??

Butters!

I dunno. Craig, is that you?

Craig, dude, wait up.

He's not meaner than Sparky.

You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.

God damn it God damn it!

Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.

Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 

...conformist.

I do not!

He's a really nice kid.

Smug?

What the hell kind of flowers are those?

It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.

We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

No.

Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.

It might hold the key to a curse.

Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?

Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.

Aaawww.

Whoa, he built a wicker basket

But I don't understand why we have to--

Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!

...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.

You can do it Mr. Mackey.

Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?

It's gonna be alright, Kyle.

Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.

You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!

I don't get it.

I don't get it, Kenny.

Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.

Quick, jump through the window.

Alright, so where is it?

Oh no!

Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

What's it say? What's it say?

Hello? Hello, anybody here? 

No, no, it's not.

No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!

I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.

Let me talk to my dad! 

I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.

What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!

I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.

...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.

Did you bring the camera?

Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."

Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 

A whatbian?

What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!

Tell them to get away now!

...Asshole. 

Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.

Where'd he go? 

My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.

What?

I'll try

O-K, deal.

The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.

Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.

...Yyyeah.

Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!

Bad!

Well, what can I do to get back my money-?

Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.

Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 

Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.

Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.

Things seem pretty quiet.

Oh dude, there goes one.

Wow, cool!

I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.

Yeah. 

My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.

Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 

He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.

Who was that?

Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.

Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 

See, I told you dude.

Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!

It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.

I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody

Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?

Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 

What?! But you made him into a basketball player.

We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.

Come on you guys, I have an idea.

No!

Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 

We're building a clubhouse.

This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 

Yeah, that one!

Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.

The principal? Aw, come on!

Thanks a lot, Frida!

...What?

All right, the county fair's still open! 

I'm not going to kill you grampa!

Ah! Oh, dude!

But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!

I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.

What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?

Whatever happened to Kenny?

So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!

Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!

...Ye-eah.

Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.

She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 

I'll kick your ass, Cartman! 

Where did it go?  Huhhh. 

Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 

We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!

Who are you people?

Yeah, it's kinda weird.

Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.

Wait wait, where the hell are we now?

All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!

Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.

B-bani-banishment?

Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!

Yeah, no, this is great.

The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.

Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 

For what, dude?

Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.

What?

Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!

Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!

Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?

Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.

No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.

Who are you?

to make it spin.

I don't know.

Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!

No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.

What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.

But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!

Mom, gross! 

Huh?

Why?

Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?

Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!

Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.

Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.

Dad? Is that you?

Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.

I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

No you didn't!

Wendy, look! 

What's that?

I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.

What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?

We've gotta help him, dude.

But you said that there were-

No, no, we've just gotta find better help.

No!

I knew it.

This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.

Wow! Good job, dude!

He said I can stay.

Who are you?

They took yer jarb!!

Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.

Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.

Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.

Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.

Dude!

No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!

Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.

Dude, we we have to go check this out.

All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 

From Vietnam veterans.

Did the Devil show up yet?

Oh hey Kyle.

No, I can't even kill a deer.

Dad, what are you doing?!

What?

Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-

Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.

What worked?

Awesu-home!

Dude, you are so retarded!

Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.

And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.

A boat?

You are now.

Well?

Oh, never mind. 

Wow. Clubhouses are magical.

Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.

Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.

Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.

No more Chef.

Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!

We did it! Yeah!

He's been up there for like, three weeks.

Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.

Visitors are real.

Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.

You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?

Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!

What the hell was that?

Hey, where did you guys go?

No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! 

Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.

Hi, doctor. 

'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.

That didn't sparkle with her, did it?

Come on, where are they? 

That's not neato, that sucks.

Kyle! 

No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?

This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.

Hey Kenny! 

But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.

What?

Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!

I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.

There! The television department!

Can you speak in present-day English please?

Oh no. No, no, no!

I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?

Is he doing it again?

What are you doing, Gorak!

Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 

Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.

Why not just pull over?

Son of a bitch stupid FBI!

Butters!

Thanks for the ride, Manuel.

It fell;

You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!

But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 

YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!

More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.

Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!

We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.

Uh, Butters, could we have it?

For giving Howard Stern a hummer!

Oh, good.

Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 

Come on, let's go. 

Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.

Butters!

Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-

Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 

Just put it between his eyes.

That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

That trick sucks, Jesus.

So?

GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 

Kyle?

Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.

Why does it matter?!

No. 

Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.

Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.

There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!

God! Shut up!

What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?

You're not?

Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.

Sweet.

Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.

Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.

Dude, we are on the front page!

Look, Kyle. Look. 

Yeah. Yeah, I get you.

To where?

Pff it's like, that's here  and...

You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"

Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?

You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?

Come on, we're running out of time. 

Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.

What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!

Well, uh-what do you mean?

It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!

Hey, what are you guys doing here?

You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 

Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.

Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?

There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.

Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?

Chef!!

So, this is gonna make me happy?

Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-

Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!

I don't want to go to this stupid party!

Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!

We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?

Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.

He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.

Dude, what?

Dude!

Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.

Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?

We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-

I'm not shooting anybody.

They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.

"Or does she?"

Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 

And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.

Dude, look.

No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!

Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.

Awww!

Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.

Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.

No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 

I don't know. 

And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?

I can't. I was banished for not voting.

Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.

Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.

Over here! 

We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?

We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.

Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.

I know, but there's nothing I can do.

Yep. Tomorrow night.

Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 

Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?

We don't want to torture you.

I'm Raggedy Andy.

Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.

You don't?

Don't hurt it! 

Fine!

How can you eat when you're farting fire?

Hey assholes! 

No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?

Okay! 

Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- 

He's losing weight. 

Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.

No thanks. I'll stand.

Huh?

Awwww!

Don't kill Kenny!

Nooo!

Um, cool.

But Mom...

...A what?

Oh gosh, killed Kenny!

Right. Uh, see ya.

What?! Kyle?!

Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?

I can shoot you, fat ass!

The list was a forgery, Kyle!

We all want double-desserts today!

Jesus Christ.

Yeah, we did that!

He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.

They're not?

You do?

AAAA! 

Cool.

Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?

Oh my God, she killed Kenny!

Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!

Yeah.

There is what again? 

Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!

Yeah!

Aw Jesus, not again.

Yeah, this line is way too long!

Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

Yeah, yeah, we do!

We don't?

I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?

Did you get to any dirty parts yet?

Dude! W-what are you doing?

Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.

Oh no. 

What the hell just happened?

Sparky, bad dog!

So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?

Yeah.

Wall Street?

Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 

Oh no, no, NO.

Yeah, they do, Kyle.

...sort of.

...Hello?

Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.

Football.

See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."

You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!

What the hell are you doing here?!

Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 

So what is the secret of Easter?

Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.

Sure, Wendy, whatever.

No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.

Dad, we're going back!

Dude, how long has your future self been around?

Jesus.

I know, huh?

Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.

I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?

What?

Dude, come back here! 

Damn.

You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?

Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault

We can't let him down, you guys.

Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!

Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.

Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 

Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 

That sounds like shit!

Sure I do!

Yes…

Visitors!

Dad?!

What?!

All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 

Yeah.

But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!

Cartman, calm down!

Did Kyle know about this?!

Sure.

Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!

But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?

Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.

Just for a minute. Over here. 

Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.

U-uh, Chef.

Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.

No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?

Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!

Get a hold of yourself, man!

You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.

Oh crap, dude!

Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 

Quit it.

Come on, Kyle! 

Uh... war?

Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!

All right Butters!

Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 

Just... play something else! God!

We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.

Can I come in?

Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.

Jesus dude! 

Wait, whattaya mean no?

Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!

No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.

It's boring.

No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!

This guy rules!

What the hell do you want?!

Yeah.

Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.

Towelie!

Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!

Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.

Well, at least you got it out of your system.

I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.

Come on, Ninjas! 

Just get across the river! They're coming! 

Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.

Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.

YES.

Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.

Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! 

Well, yeah.

Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.

Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!

We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.

What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!

So why can't he live here now?

Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 

No.  Screw this, dude. 

Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.

I guess this is it.

Goddamnit, what now?!

It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 

Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!

Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!

Ha! They're your diseases!

Cartman?!

They're really that good?

What, you got asthma or something?

Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 

No, I just, I don' know. No.

Uh, Chef.

(I don't think I like this new law.)

Whoa whoa wait, wait! 

So how did it go last night? 

Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 

Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?

What's all gone?

They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?

Dude, Cartman.

It's cool dude, we understand.

Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.

Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.

I'll try to make it spin.

I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.

Go long, Token! Go go! 

Accept it! 

Thanks, dude.

What are you talking about?

That's a little strange, isn't it?

Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.

I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.

See? She liked my present the best!

Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.

No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 

This is happening way too fast.

'K.

We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.

Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.

No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.

You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.

What is it, Mom?

I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 

Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.

Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 

No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.

Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.

...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!

Where's he?

The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.

Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.

Sacrificed? For what?

I kept it secret, for two days!

...Wait, what were we doing again?

You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.

Uh, Wendy?

Do you feel anything?

Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.

Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.

Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?

What?!

No, dude, don't! 

Please, it's important.

Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 

Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.

Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.

Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 

What?

What??

Yes you can, porky. 

Dude, is he here every year like this?

Chef, we're intolerant. 

What?!

Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.

Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.

Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?

But the girls like singing and dancing.

Get down Sparky! Down!

Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...

What?

Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 

Oh all right.

What do you think, Officer Barbrady?

Well, I guess we learned our lesson.

Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.

No problem, Gorak.

Thanks. 

If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.

But I have to know for sure. 

Cartman, what are you doing?

Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?

They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?

...Yeah.

Dad, what are you doing?

I dunno.

Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!

Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!

Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.

What?? 

No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?

I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!

Where's the going-away party?

And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 

So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?

Dude, this is my room!

Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.

We're not straight! You're straight!

Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 

Alright, alright, here. 

No.

But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?

Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.

You mean the old Galveston Lodge? 

I- told them where to find you.

Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 

Standing by in three seconds.

My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 

Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 

We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.

Go ahead, dude. 

We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.

No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!

There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 

I think his name is Junjun.

Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 

This is great!

I know where.

Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?

He wants to know where he is.

Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.

Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.

Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 

Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?

...Wow. 

Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.

My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.

What do we want?

What grade are you going into?

Yeah, you stupid umbassday!

Okay, next? 

Fox trot standing by at position alpha.

What about him?

We're the ones you told to get Internet money.

We travel back in time.

O-ogh...

We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?

Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! 

So now we are in th real world.

Hey dude.

Kind of bitter.

Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!

No! I broke the fucking dam!

What about San Francisco?

No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.

Okay... 

Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.

You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?

What did he do?

Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.

Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.

Well I don't drink coffee.

Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 

Sounds like police sirens.

What?

Ohhhhhhh.

Well you have to convince them they are real!

Why did they have us put on long underwear.

Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!

You forgot!

It is?? 

No, he's not.

Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?

You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.

"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."

I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.

All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!

The addict people said something about me filling a hole.

It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 

Dude, these people are insane.

Damn, dude, this place is huge! 

Dude, I really don't see a problem.

With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.

Isn't that your job?

Yeah, I think he was. Wait.

Oh, Red Lobster.

Come on, dude, it's not that hard!

Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!

But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.

Hang on.

Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 

Hey guys.

We made it! 

There it is. The Okama GameSphere. 

I'll be there, you queen!

God-damnit!

They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."

When do we want it?

You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.

That's not disciprine.

Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!

Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!

Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?

I know.

All right.

Hide and go seek, huh?!

...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.

Sure I will grampa, I will.

Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.

Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 

Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.

Bad.

Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!

So, what are you and Wendy doing?

You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!

Because, I know what did cause the flood.

No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.

Dude, this isn't working.

Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.

No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.

Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 

'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.

Get out of here!

I just wanna find something else to play.

Why did Chef quit?

That's not very imaginative.

Go on, Butters!

Come on! Come on! 

...Wow.

Okay we got it! We got it! 

You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.

Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!

What the hell was that?

Aooooo!

Dude, what the-&#160;? 

... What?

Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.

Indy! 

Just do it really fast, and we can go.

Could you just hand us some food please?

Commercial Break Number Two! 

You mean, Cartman's side is right?

Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 

Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.

Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-

What?

Yeah, I remember hearing about that.

We did it!! 

Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.

Rad! 

Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!

What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.

Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.

Yeah-

Chef, we're in a repeat.

Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!

'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.

Just run with it, dude.

For what?

Yeah.

Ooogh.

But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?

Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.

What's going on?

Must I?

No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.

You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 

Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  

S- hold it a while, okay?

Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? 

See you around, dude. 

Fine.

My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 

I' seems fine.

Then why are you packing fudge?

Cartman isn't our friend anymore. 

I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 

It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 

Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.

All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 

You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!

Yeah, I think that's great too.

Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.

So?

Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!

Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 

Hey. 

Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 

Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!

He does? 

Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.

God dammit!

Uh, Earth?

Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? 

Oh yeah.

Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."

Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 

But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.

I know! This is awesome!

Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! 

Yeah?

Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!

Oh no, what now?

Come on, we gotta go check on him. 

No, Dad-

Well, who didn't see that coming?

What?!

Heheheh hehehe...

I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!

Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?

Yeah, us too.

Yup.

But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.

We can't let our party suck.

Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.

So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?

But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?

Yeah.

'K 

Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.

...Well then why aren't we waking up?

Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.

Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 

I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!

Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?

Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?

Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 

Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.

Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.

Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?

There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!

We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.

Where am I supposed to get a gun?

Holy crap. dude!

Stop it, Mom!

The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.

Oh, phew.

What's that?

Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 

Hi Grandpa.

Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.

Yeah, we know better than to think that.

No, he's annoying.

Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!

Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?

He's just dancing around.

It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-

This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!

But why?

Fine! 

...Um, no?

Holy shit!

When do we want it?

How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?

You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!

I raced you, You won!

We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!

Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.

Yahtzee. Sixes.

What?

Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?

Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!

God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!

What's Arkansas—is that a state?

Butters. 

What is that?

He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.

No way, dude!

How?

That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.

'Cause, I'll get in trouble.

So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.

Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!

Yeah.

Timecist?

Pry his mouth open!

Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.

Dude, bail! Bail! 

What?

Whoa!

Come on, Dad!

Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.

Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!

Angry Clit Spasm

You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?

Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 

I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.

What?!

Huh?

Don't care, don't care, don't care.

Hey dudes.

Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.

Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!

But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!

What, dude?

Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!

Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.

Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 

Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.

Wow, you made this?

Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? 

Come on, Chef!

It'll get better, guys.

I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.

Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 

Doing what?

But why? Why would you quit?

Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?

Dude! He bailed on us!

How do we stretch that into five minutes?

Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.

Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?

He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.

Thank you.  Mr. Hankey. 

No, I'm Stan.

Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?

Look, I really need my bike.

Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.

We might pass him off as our pet.

Hey, yeah! 

Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--

Butters, don't be such a pussy.

Over here, over here!

Dude! 

Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.

Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.

Shut up Cartman!

What was that?

All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.

Nooo-ho! 

I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-

They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!

Yes! It's over! It's over!

Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.

Here you go.

Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.

Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.

We all have to do this report together, dude.

Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.

Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.

It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!

No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.

We only have music class on Thursday.

Wow, coo-hul!

Huh?

No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!

Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?

AAAAAAAAH! 

What?

That's not in the script  They do this all the time.

We won't! 

That's it! Hurry! Gooo! 

There's nothin' to do.

Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 

Yeah! How'd you know?

Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.

Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?

Cartman??

But we don't like her.

Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 

Dad, I'm scared.

Dude! How did you do that, Butters?

Good luck with your company, dude.

I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!

Well how sick?

What'cha do to Butters this time?

Dad? Dad, we need to talk.

Yeah!

If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.

You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!

Oh, don't worry about him.

Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-

You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.

Okay, here we go. 

Wow, poor Kenny.

Sorry.

We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 

Tor- torture you?

Hey, Jesus.

How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.

The bus is going over!

Oh.

No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.

What are you doing?!

Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.

Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 

Divorce is stupid. 

If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.

We sit.

What?

Can you see anything? 

Well I can't spend any money.

I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.

Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 

Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.

This is um, Thad Jarvis.

Kyle, come on!

forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!

Not that. Did you actually go to that?

What's a prostitute?

Where's your costume, fatass?

Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.

Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.

Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!

I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.

Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.

Oh.

Adam Sandler's funny.

This isn't working.

Chef, we have to talk to you!

Come on, Butters. Time to go.

Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.

All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.

Goddammit!

Whoa, dude!

No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!

Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.

Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!

Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.

I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.

Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?

Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.

Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.

Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.

She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.

Dude! Did you get 'em?

Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!

'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.

Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!

Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!

All the world destroyed?

Yeah. Yeah, there is.

Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.

Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.

So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.

Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!

No! 

"Scream for me, bitch!"

Shelly?

So where's the other doctor? 

Alright, go Cartman.

Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.

That's cool.

Cool!

Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 

We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 

Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 

Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.

He doesn't have to do homework?

No grampa, I'll get in trouble.

McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?

What?!

So you'll do it?

Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.

You do?

I know. 

The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.

Bitch. Bitch.

Oh God, you guys, really? This again? 

Why?

Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 

Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.

Dad??

How do you guys make them so yummy?

Where's our desks?

The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!

Where were you guys going?!

Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.

But no! I have to get the girls to come-

Why are you doing this, dude?

Who's the Boss?

I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.

Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!

Butters.

You're dead, Mr. Jackson!

Sure, dude, you're our friend.

But I don't think it's working.

So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?

But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?

Uuh, yeah.

No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!

I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.

Put it out, put it out! 

Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

What the hell happened here? 

Butters. Dude!

Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!

Dad?

You don't like doing it?

Oh-hoho!

Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 

Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?

Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?

No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!

Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.

Wow! 

Oh, hey Kenny.

Aw, crap!

Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.

Whattaya mean?

What do we want?

Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.

Have you seen any panda bears?

All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.

Yeah.

Get them out of there!

Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 

Even in the girls' bathroom! 

Aaaah!! 

It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?

All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!

Run, Blanket, Run!

Well, what do you mean?

And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 

Hey dude.

Well go on, then! Sue me!

He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.

That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.

Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!

Superfatass?

We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 

Here they come!

Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?

Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...

No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.

Dad, no!  You killed my father. 

Dude, you did make a deal... 

Yeah, I wanna know already.

Really?

We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?

Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.

They want his power?

Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!

No.

Yeahhhh!

Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.

Yeah, what's the problem?

We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 

Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.

Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 

He hits this switch- 

Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.

Dude.

"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez." 

And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.

Wha-a-a negroplasty??

So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.

Why do you have to see an eye doctor?

Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.

Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 

Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.

Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.

Dude, we are total rock stars now!

Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.

Hello?

How does someone get herpes?

Come on, Dad! Get up!

Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!

Shut up, Pip.

Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!

Why?

Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!

What? 

Why do you keep saying "hella," fatass?!

Ughh.

Good luck. 

All right, so how do I join you?

Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 

We'll hold 'em off.

Hurry dude!

He's really old and going blind.

Oh, dude, let's go!

What the hell is going on?!

Fine, Mom.

What are you talking about?

Yeah.

Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.

Cool. 

Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.

You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?

Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. 

But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.

It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!

Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 

Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?

What are you goin' to do, dude?

But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.

They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!

You tell 'em, Cartman!

Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?

Take us out of port! All hands to stations!

Let's go, Park! Come on!

Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.

We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.

Yeah, come on guys, this is war! 

No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!

Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 

Winter's back!

Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??

Yeah, where's all the fighting?

There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!

Well, ah, I mean...

Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?

Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.

Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?

No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.

Aw, crap.

Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 

Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.

Fifteen bucks?!

Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.

Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!

We know what you are, lady!

You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.

I do.

Yeah, pretty much.

This is more math than I've ever seen you do.

Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.

Aw crap!

Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.

No, dad, no. No, please!

Uh oh.

Why? 

You tricked us, Cartman!

Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 

Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.

Shut up Cartman!

Then damnit man, do it!

What's that?

I know.

Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.

Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.

...Thanks a lot, dude.

Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.

Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.

What are we doing here Chef?

They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?

I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 

It is?

Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 

Oh, no.

He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.

Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 

It's cool, dude. We'll help you.

...Yeah.

Dad, why did they do that?

Call an ambulance.

You don't come to this country and make fun of it!

Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program? 

So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 

He seemed better on TV?

You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!

Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.

Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.

Yeah.

You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?

Kickass!

Where?

Please, I don't wanna go back with them.

Yup.

Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 

He's right.

Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.

Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!

Dude, I hate my family. 

That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?

I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.

DVD? We don't own a DVD player.

No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.

Dad!  You're the greatest. 

But isn't he only three years old?

Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.

Kyle! Run! 

Really?

Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?

Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!

Great. A lot of help you are, kid.

Cartman?

Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 

Why do you wanta know, lady?!

Oh my God, he killed Kenny!

Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?

Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? 

Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?

We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.

Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 

Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?

Dude, that kicks ass!

Damn, dude. Look at all these people.

I guess... 

Dude, what the hell?

Nice going, fat boy!

No, dad! No!

Washington Redskins.  I like it!

'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.

Chef!

Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 

Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!

Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.

Timmy, you have to stop!

Why do you say that?

He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!

...Dude.

Oh, Jesus.

No, I just--

We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.

Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--

Alien?

He's not gonna do it.

I wanna return a fish.

You mean, like Kenny?

This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!

Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!

Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.

Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.

How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?

Okay, okay.

Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!

No!

No no! We weren't gonna go there!

Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 

Really?  Thank you.

Yeah.

Huh? Hello? Who is that? 

Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?

Dude, I have to!

Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.

Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.

How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!

Sick dude, she's my sister.

What's the matter with him.

What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!

I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.

From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?

I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.

All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.

Look! 

Awww dude, awwww.

Good job, wizard.

On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.

Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?

Come on, we'd better hurry. 

Hey Kyle.

Cartman, are you feeling alright?

Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.

Bleech! 

Oh, no, no, no no no no.

Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 

Oh no!

I took them to see how abortions are done.

Wwhat do you mean?

You've had five, dude!

Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!

Come on you guys, let's go home. 

I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.

Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.

Hey, he talks!

You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 

I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.

Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?

Uh that's okay.

Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

Yeah?

Dad, do we really have to wear bras?

Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.

That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!

Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.

We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.

Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 

Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 

Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 

No! You don't need another beer!

Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!

It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.

Oh, that's a good idea.

You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!

All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 

Oh, yes we do.

Nno, that's stupid too. 

Well that burned a long time.

What?

And it was like WHAM. 

Kyle? Kyle, what happened?

Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!

Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?

Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?

Dude, we can't work with this kid.

No you're not! I don't think I missed any!

Aw, dude, come on!!

Dad Dad, we have a problem.

I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.

Who are you?

Dude, please. Kyle needs it.

What?

Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?

Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?

I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.

You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 

But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.

So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?

Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.

Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.

Yeah. Now what are you going to do?

Booooo!

...Huh??

Teacher, our egg is... okay. 

Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?

What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.

...Free? 

Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?

Tweek is!

E mouths...

Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.

It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.

Aw come on, Kyle.

You know, dude, there might be something to this.

Hi, Jesus. It's me,

No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.

Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 

This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.

Did so!

Jesus Christ!

Have you confessed all your sins yet?

What disease should we say?

Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.

Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.

Kyle??

Aww!

You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!

Kyle? What's happening?

I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. 

Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!

You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.

Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?

I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.

No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.

Mr. Garrison, stop!

That does it, dude!

What was that? 

Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.

What are you talking about?

Who is that? 

I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 

You didn't find him, I found him.

Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.

Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.

How the hell should we know? 

You'd better shut up, Craig.

Well, what about going to hell and all that?!

But he's funny.

Okay.

That's stupid, Cartman.

God damnit!

Come on, you guys. 

You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.

No.

Bad.

Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?

What's a dildo?

You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!

An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.

Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 

Oh, ah thank God you found me.

Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.

Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?

Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.

I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?

Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?

Yeah. Or, we could not.

Dude, who the hell are you?

We have come to return the weapons we purchased.

Cartman, you can't do that!

You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.

Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??

Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?

Totally gay.

I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.

I don't know. 

Immortal.

...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.

Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.

Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?

Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!

Come on, dude!

Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!

Are you the head of Homeless Studies?

Oh boy.

Did you know your mom was from Jersey?

All right, can you explain to me what's going on?

Ooooooo...

Oh my God, how does it know the answer?

Grandpa?

Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!

Put that away, dude! 

Come on, you guys! This is our town!

So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?

We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 

Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 

Phillip? That's not Phillip.

No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.

Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.

What is it, Craig?

We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!

Come on, let's do this!

Yeah. I totally don't get it.

Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!

Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!

Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.

Exactly!

No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 

Yeah, of course. 

They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.

All right! Let's do this!

Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"

That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!

To stop bullying.

Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!

Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.

Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.

Your family is rich, dude.

Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.

What's your ninja name, Kenny?

I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.

Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-

Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!

Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!

Ah our client has an audition to this show.

He looks pretty happy to me.

Is this for real?? This is for real!

JUST RUN!! 

Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 

How about Token? 

Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 

Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?

Bad.

Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.

Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.

Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.

Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.

Where are you?

Doesn't it give any other directions?

Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.

Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.

Uh, thanks.

He wanted money?

Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!

Cartman, no!

Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

Well, we don't take kindly to you!

Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.

Aw spit! 

Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.

You're on, fatass! 

Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?

Wait, I don't get it.

Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??

We win again! 

Who are you people?

Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.

I don't understand!

What?

That self-promoting asshole!

Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.

Hey Tweek.

How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?

Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??

I think I have a better idea.

Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.

Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.

Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 

Elton John! What are you doing here?

Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?

Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.

You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.

Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.

Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.

Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.

Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.

I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?

"Awgh! I'm so fat!"

This guy sucks! 

Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!

Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.

It sure did.

Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.

Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.

We'd love them!

Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?

It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!

You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?

I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.

Kyle!

Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 

Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."

No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.

Dad!

Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.

Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?

Aw, really?

Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.

We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 

Where's our Bible?

Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.

But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.

But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.

I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!

Damnit Cartman, wha-?!

We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?

I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.

Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 

Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!

That looks AWEsome! 

Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!

Butters!

No! I have to get it out!

No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!

You got a computer?

Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!

Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...

...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 

Again?

Word of curse?

What?

Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

What?? 

Come on, Tweek! You got him!

They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.

Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.

And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.

Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.

Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 

Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.

Cartman, wake up!

...Stan.

Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.

Kyle!

No problem, dude.

I don't wanna go back there.

Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.

Oh my God!

Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.

Really?

It's supposed to be a frog!

What the hell?

Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?

We've got to hide!

Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!

Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.

Hey, Chef!

Woof.

All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.

Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.

No, never.

Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?

Chef, we need more food.

What are you going to do?

Russian?

Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?

That's it, screw this game!

Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.

No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!

Two hundred dollars.

Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.

Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

That's a cool idea

He did it!

Wow. How did that happen?

We got invited too, fatass!

No!

Okay. Action! 

Here. Wu-we don't want it.

Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 

Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 

Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!

Our case?

No, you just have to study.

Wendy?

Huh? What? Have they come for us?

I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.

Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.

What?

He's like, some frozen guy.

Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.

Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 

Okay, that's good, a little higher.

Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 

What, Butters?

Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.

Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! 

Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.

And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.

Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.

You got it, Ken? 

I'm sure glad that's over with. 

I don't know!

Dude, you totally lied to me!

Dude, what are you saying??

Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!

I don't know.  Whoa. 

That was freakin' hardcore.

Sounds like shit.

...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 

Okay, go ahead and start.

Jesus Christ!

...What?

I don't know. 

You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.

Where? I can't see.

I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.

I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!

Where are they?

I'm not responsible for what my dad did!

When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 

Oh crap! It's that guy again! 

Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 

Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.

Will you stop that?

No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 

Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?

Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!

Oh Jesus, he's about to play! 

Like what?

Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.

They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 

That's great.

You did?

Hey Wendy.

Yeah, it's unbelievable.

Kiya! Kiya!

W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 

Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?

Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?

Wow, he IS great at sucking.

What the hell is he talking about?

Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! 

Oh no! It's locked!

Hey, it's happening again. 

Super best friends?

I found this frozen guy in the woods today.

Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.

Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.

Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.

Yeah, go on dude!

Does Mom know about this?

Go where?

Having sex with women.

No! This is stupid!

Oh, my God! They've killed--

You aren't alone. 

Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.

O-okay.

No, stop! Raape!

G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.

Yeah!

Now's our chance!

Quick, we need something to carry him in!

You're not more mature than us, Cartman!

Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.

Huh?!  O-oh.

Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.

I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.

Hey look, there's something here.

I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!

They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.

I'm sure they'll be here any minute.

Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.

My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.

I can't, I just can't.

Yeah, quit being such a baby.

Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!

You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 

Weak!  Dad?

Kyle, NO! 

I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!

They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.

Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!

Who?

Could you pull over so I can get out?

South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!

Wait, look! The helicopter! 

I bet I scored 100!

Butters!  Did you bring it?

I can't believe it! It's all a scam!

Aah! Run, dude, run!

I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.

Yup.

NO.

But Dad-

Nothing

What?

Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.

It's a mirror.

No, I was supposed to be home at eight.

Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.

'Kay.

We just need to borrow him, kid. 

Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?

Sure, whatever dude.

Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!

Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.

Christmas?

Who the hell are you?

Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?

But I don't know any of this stuff.

No, mom!

And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.

It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.

Hit A and X together.

After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 

Well, get away from us then.

Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?

Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?

Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!

We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!

Your eyes? 

It's dead.

No, I'm on the Japanese side.

No!

'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.

You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 

Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 

What's up dude?

What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!

Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?

Fine, how are you?

It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.

What? D-dad, are are you dying?

Butters, what happened?

Hello. We need to go...  here. 

Hooray! 

Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??

Oh Jesus, here we go.

Yeah dude, you can test them.

Aww, it's all warm!

I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.

He's back!

I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.

With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?

...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?

You buying school lunch today?

Sally Struthers is saving us!

Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?

Yeah, it's fun.

I'm going too. 

Watch my coat, dude.

No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!

Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!

Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.

A way to finally do something good for other people.

Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 

Now do you people believe me?

You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!

Okay, good.

It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.

Phew.

And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.

We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.

It's like... they know. 

Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 

Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!

It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.

This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 

Tralalalala

What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 

Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.

Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.

Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.

Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 

Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. 

Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?

Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 

The hell are you doing, dad?

You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?

What's that you're wearing?

You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 

Why would Iraqis do that? Why?

Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!

Come on, dude. 

No, he's not.

Jimmy's funny, dude.

Yes.

Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.

Yeah.

We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!

Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!

Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 

What?

Hey Chef. Look.

Bleech!

What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 

I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!

Good. A-and action! 

Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.

You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 

Sure dude.

Me. I'm asking the question.

All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.

Okay, Manuel, hit it. 

See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.

Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.

Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!

Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!

Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?

He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.

Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.

Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!

They're still asleep.

We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?

Gay people?

But why?

Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!

Dude, he did that to me this morning.

Yeah. It does. 

No, dad! We need your keys!

Dude, Butters, calm down.

Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.

How's he doing?

You suck now, Kyle! 

Dad! Dad, they shot at us.

So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?

Ah, Canada?

Huh?  Oh yeah.

'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.

Damn it! 

Grampa!! 

...I don't believe it.

The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.

Yeah. Let's play ball.

Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!

I am?? I didn't know that!

Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!

Irene, you said you loved me!

AAAAAAA! 

She has to be here! 

Yeah, but... how?

...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 

Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!

Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!

Nonono, not yet. DAD!

Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!

No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!

Maybe we were wrong about the clue.

Okay, turn on the ignition,

I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 

You tell 'em, Kyle!

But you only need one, fat boy!

There is... one person.

Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?

Okay. 

Our Cartman would never say anything like that.

Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 

Jeez, they made that into a movie already?

Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!

What?

What?

No. I broke the dam.

You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!

Crap.

Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?

You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 

But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.

Excuse us. Excuse us.

Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!

Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 

Stay clear, guys, stay clear.

How long was that?

Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.

Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?

I didn't think so.

Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 

Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 

Yeah, that's better.

Governor's office?

Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?

We we speak English!

Come on Cartman, fart!

Dude, this is awesome.

What's that?

Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.

Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 

Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!

You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!

This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.

Awww..!

Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?

Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.

You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.

This land is not for sale.

Oh uh, hey Nelson.

Alright, I'll chip in.

Really nice work, guys.

Dude, we're not killing your mom.

Cartman's a girl now?

What about me?

Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.

Hey. Where's Kenny?

Ohhh.

We... don't work for any-body.

So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?

Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 

Dad! Dad!

Sick, dude!

Butters?

Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.

Not everybody pees in pools.

No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.

Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.

God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!

Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.

Kyle! No!

I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-

But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.

Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.

Okay.

There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.

Grampa!

That isn't funny.

I, I can't, I can't believe it.

Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 

I guess, but-- 

To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.

Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!

Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.

Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!

Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?

Well WHAT, Cartman?

Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 

Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.

We have to do something. Let's form a club.

I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.

What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.

Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.

So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 

Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 

Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.

He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

What the hell is going on here?

Yeah.

Shut up, Cartman?

Oh God, here we go again.

...Whoops.

Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?

Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.

Uh, over here please?

Whatcha doin'?

You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!

Fine! 

Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.

Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 

Oh my God, he killed Kenny.

Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.

All right!

Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.

Hey! Hey, open the door!

Wow, the Moses.

Damn it!

Because it's really, really funny.

All right. 

Yeah... Or you. 

What happened then? 

Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!

Yeah.

... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?

No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 

Who is that?

What?

But her note said she'd be here. 

Dude, the two male judges love her.

I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!

Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.

There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.

Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!

We're here! It's the water park! 

Like who?

Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!

But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.

Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!

I guess.

It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 

But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.

No ma'am.

No he's not.  Is he?

Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.

I've been getting my best friend back.

The American Association of Retired Persons.

He's the fat one.

...Enchirito?

Aw, damnit!

Dad, Death is coming!

Sure.

Oh no.

Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?

What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!

I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.

It just all seemed so... stupid.

What?

Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.

Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.

Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!

Kyle, I need to use your Internet

WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!

All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.

What? How do you know she has a cat? 

Dad. Dad! 

Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.

Yeah, huh, I got you!

Tell them not to burn us down.

Cool!

Did I what?

Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.

Ogh.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

Dad?

Owww.

Dad!

What can I do?

Ow! 

Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.

No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.

God-damnit!

Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.

Yes you do! Now, dig! 

I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 

Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?

Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.

During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!

We've gotta hurry this up. 

Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.

Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!

You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.

No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.

Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.

Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 

But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.

What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!

Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?

Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.

Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?

What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?

Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.

Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??

Oh, thank God.

Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!

That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.

It wa a trick!

Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.

Who's that?

What are you doing, dad?

Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.

That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!

Dude, we don't care.

No, it can't be.

Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!

There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.

I'm not friends with him.

Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.

Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.

Oh no, what now? 

I've had a great teacher.

I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.

Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!

What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.

Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 

Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 

Just a second fat-ass!

I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 

Jesus Christ. 

A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?

Oh boy!

Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!

Ah fuck.

Oh my God...

Help you how?

I don't like it. It's spooky.

What does that mean?

Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.

Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.

Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...

Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!

Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.

There it is! American Idol contestants!

She's stealing Chef from us.

We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.

Oh never mind, I hate him again.

A what?

Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?

Why does that matter?

Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 

Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.

Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.

Fuck off, Dad. 

Dude, you okay? 

Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 

Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?

Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 

Dude. We lost.

Yeah, I think I get it.

Hello? 

Cartman dude, not now.

All right, all right, all right! God! 

Wait, woodland critters... 

No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt

Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.

Dude, how'd you do that?

Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.

Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!

I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.

Ow, that sucks, dude!

I don't know you!

Yeah, dude.

I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.

Do something, Kyle! 

But that's just you and your friends.

No dude, you gotta help us find him!

Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??

Oh God-damnit!

What are you doing, Cartman?

I don't know.

Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.

Uh... Hooray.

Like John Elway important?

Fries... fries...

Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!

Calm down, tubby.

We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.

What??

Huh?

Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?

Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?

Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!

But what about them?

So unfair... so unfair.

You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?

Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.

Try to find a way past it!

Imagina-he-hey-

Dude, it is called History Channel.

Whoa. Dude, no way!

It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.

I don't know.

Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.

Aw dude, that's so sad. 

You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!

Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.

Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider

Hi, Wendy.

Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?

Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!

His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.

...Bail. 

That's because I was pissed off!

Well, you sure seem happy about it!

What the hell is going on? 

Oh no.

He did it!

No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?

Dude, no way.

See what?

Dude!

Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.

Ogh. 

Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.

Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?

Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.

Yeah!

I don't know.

I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls

It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.

Cartman, you idiot!

Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.

There he is!

Butters, we're running away!

Yeah, let's go race it right now!

I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.

Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!

They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.

Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.

I'll try

I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.

Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.

What?! Why?!

Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!

Oh, hey Butters.

Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.

Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.

Well, what does it say?

Are you serious? We never heard that.

Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!

Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.

Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.

None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!

Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.

All right, let's go. 

What? What's the big deal?

Is something wrong, Wendy? 

Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.

If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!

Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.

I'm having the best time!

There she is!

Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.

Get all the stuff! 

Kyle? 

I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.

Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. 

Dude, did you do all your homework last night?

There she is! 

Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.

No!

Kyle! Du-what is going on?!

You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!

That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.

Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!

Huh??

He is in there.

Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.

I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.

But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?

I can't afford a cruise, dude.

What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.

MMOOMM!

Dude, it's Timmy.

Yeah! Go away, Pip!

No.

Butters called Customer Service first?

No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.

No!

That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.

Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!

Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.

Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.

You know, freshen up your breath.

He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.

Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?

Hey, what's up?

Okay, good.

See? That's what happened to me!

But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!

Huh? But you just got dumped

You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!

Why does he keep saying that?

You-you're all joking, right?

Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.

Yeah it does.

Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.

I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?

Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.

Uh-oh.

Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.

All right, they finally came for us. 

Did you get it? 

Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.

Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?

We're heroes!

The hell do they want? 

Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!

Profile? I'm not a profile.

Huff, huff

I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!

I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.

Sounds good.

I think so.

Oh man, really?

Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 

Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!

Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.

Sshh!

How?

Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.

Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!

You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 

Oh, thanks.

You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"

He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-

Mom, what are you doing?

Today, we've made history.

I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!

Wait! Where are you going?

I don't know. Let's go see. 

So?

Kyle, Kyle! Look. 

And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!

Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 

Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 

Shut up, Butters!

What, dude? 

...You sound like Cartmam.

Dude, what are you guys doing?

Get us down from here!

They're back!

Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!

Alright, now it's time for phase 2.

To the moon?

Dude, we are in so much trouble!

Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?

So Bono's newest record is a lie!

Huh? 

He's right there.

Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?

Oh crap, the gingers!

Hello?

Kyle, you have to keep playing.

It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!

Wow!

What's the big idea, Craig?!

Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.

Here it goes.

Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 

Oh, cool. A preview. 

We don't wanna hear it.

You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!

Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 

Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 

Hey it looks different.

No, that's way too long!

'Scuse me.

Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 

Dad, isn't this a little extreme?

We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.

You were looking for a talent agent?

I don't know what the hell that is...

AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!

I don't believe that he's my future self!

The bell rang. Can we go?

Dude, we don't remember.

Excuse me.

He's really got it out for you, dude.

What's the problem?

Come on, guys. 

No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.

Get back inside! 

No problem.

Aww! 

Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?

No, because I really want you to kill yourself.

No, I'll go! I found him!

No! 

Wow!

Thanks. Who are you?

What's she doing?

Nobody's paying any attention. 

I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.

Not really.

Bluuuuch! 

Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!

One please.

Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...

Are we in trouble or something?

It's okay, Mom. I understand.

A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.

Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 

What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.

Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?

What is that?

Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.

Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.

E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.

Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.

You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.

See what?

Then that's where I belong.

Yup.

Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.

I called you an ass-sucker!

Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!

Wow!

Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.

Oooh.

A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!

Do you see 'er dude?

They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.

Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?

Cartman, you have to stop!

What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?

Cremated? What's that?

I know!

Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.

Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 

Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.

Alright, where's Clyde.

Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.

Dad, Dad, Stop!

...He's got us there, dude. 

Is this the right house?

You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 

Here it is. Motivation Corp. 

And what does she do?

Where have you been, Cartman?

I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 

But I thought you meant the Son of God!

I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.

Dad?

Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 

Fine, douche! 

Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! 

Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.

Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?

Dude!

Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?

What?! 

I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.

No...

Shhh!

Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!

Oh, hey.

My ass we will!

Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?

Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 

You're gonna fight Satan?

Dude! Dude, not cool!

I thought albums win either gold or platinum.

That's übercool.

Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.

My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-

We can't do this without you now! Come on! 

No, no, we don't hang out anymore.

But crackers are his- body.

Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?

I don't know! 

NO! 

I bet I get more candy than you dude.

Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.

Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage! 

Aww... he was packing fudge!

Yeah, mine too.

Ready. Let's see 'em.

Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?

All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?

Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?

Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?

Oh yeah.

Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!

Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?

We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now

Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 

I'm not bleeding out my aahass!

Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.

Come on, Butters.

Nice job, Pip.

Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.

Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?

Yeah? 

Knock it off! 

What battlefield?!

I don't know.

Dad! What the hell are you doing?!

'Kay.

Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.

Awww! 

Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?

I think I have extra.

Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 

Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?

Yeah, I wouldn't have.

It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.

Hey, we want our money back.

I literally broke the dam!

Oh thanks, dude.

What are you talking about Chef?

No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.

Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!

What's that?

It's still three weeks.

We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...

Robert Smith? Sweet!

Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.

God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.

What were you talking about?

Can't be

That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.

Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.

You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...

We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!

You're an asshole, Kyle!

Alright, here. 

Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!

Whatabutt?

Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?

Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.

From sex??

I don't want your lame-ass supper!

Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.

Aarrgghh!! 

Good-bye, Robert Smith!

Oh Jesus. 

Hey, back off!

Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!

Sshh! 

What do you think happens if you do have it?

We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!

Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!

We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.

Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.

It's right there, see? 

Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?

Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!

Hey hey, stop reading that!

Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.

Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 

But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.

What's Casa Bonita?

Sweet!

I have a button we can use for his nose.

Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!

Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.

Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!

So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.

Woww.

No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!

Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.

Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.

You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.

Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 

JESUS CHRIST!!

Damn, dude. China's fucked up.

...I don't know.  I like it.

What's going on?

Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!

Yes. No foolies.

Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?

I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."

Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?

We're rich?

Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.

All families suck ass!

Oh shit, did we do that?

The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?

Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!

Better than yours, fat boy.

You break it down!

But what if we want to give somebody herpes?

Dolphins are way smarter than you!

Where are you going, Kyle?

Uhh... no.

Hooray!

Please what?

Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.

What?! 

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Now, do you believe this, Cartman?

So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?

Brake, Kenny, brake. 

This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?

Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.

I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!

Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.

That's just an old legend.

No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.

Okay, it's all clear. 

Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.

We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!

O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?

"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?

Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.

What? 

Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.

Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!

Chef, come on!

Chef, we love you.

Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.

We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.

We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.

Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.

Oh my God! She killed Kenny!

Hoh. Hoh?

Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"

It's a lousy business. I quit.

Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.

ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!

Goddammit!

Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.

Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?

Tralalalala

Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-

Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 

Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.

A big mutant version of me?

Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.

Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 

What, dude?

I can't believe they won't ban our book!

What do I say??

Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?

... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!

Save it, Grandpa!

That's what they made me think, too!

He's alive!

Dude. You're such a grandpa.

What?

Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 

Wow, cool!

He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.

I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.

I thought you guys were pirates in a war!

What?!

Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!

They censored the image of Mohammad? How?

Oh jeez, change the channel.

Oh, uh, I'm sick.

The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.

Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?

Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.

Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!

Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 

Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 

That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball

Yeah yeah, not bad.

Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!

It fell;

Dude, this is awesome.

Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.

This is it.

Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.

Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 

Let's go, Kyle! 

Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?

He told my dad he was...

Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.

Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.

What?!

Dude, don't you remember where it is?

I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."

Dude, what is this place?

Parents?

Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?

Okay, let's get back to the room. 

Oh come on, people!

You guys, you guys!

Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-

Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. 

Do you really think we should go with this guy?

You were awesome, Token!

Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 

Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.

Awesome!

That's your flight, Butters.

Jesus Christ...

Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.

The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!

To destroy the Evil Power!

Book. Later, dude. 

No!

What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!

Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?

Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.

Did you come here to help me?

Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.

Oh, boy! We'll show them!

I see it!

Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.

... totally.

Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!

Chef.

Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!

Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? 

...and then we put them back in the tank.

What?

Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.

Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 

Because that's what we're doing!

Aw, what do we do, Chef?!

Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?

What happened?

Go on.

Fine, then you can come with me. 

I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!

That is our presentation. An idea that we call...

You call the number Kyle.

Dammit! I just want it to snow again!

Give us some, Cartman!

Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.

Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!

Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.

Yeah, I get it for that.

Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?

It fell;

Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!

Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.

We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!

No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?

Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!

That's good. 

Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?

Yeah, prob'ly

I didn't smile. 

Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?

And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.

Aw crap! 

We're not dealing drugs!

You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!

You guys, school starts in ten minutes!

Are we making love now?

Dude, sick!!! 

Come on, Kenny, hurry up!

I guess we'll just take all of 'em.

Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!

Hey, it's Big Gay Al!

Where??

Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-

I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 

You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 

I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.

He was right. You DID cause 9/11.

Just stay still, Butters.

They did?

That's it?

That doesn't sound like shit to you?

Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.

We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 

Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 

RPG, four o'clock!

It's Cartman!

Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.

Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 

You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.

It... did?

You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.

Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.

Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.

What?

What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.

Get over here and untie us! 

Apples?

Our planet is just a reality-TV show?

We don't get to go to Scotland?

Hey, Chef.

God, it took forever!

Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!

Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!

This is it??

I'm not joking.  Do it.

That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?

Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?

If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.

Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?

That would suck so much ass.

That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?

The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.

'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.

That's all it is? 

...I think I have a better idea.

Yeah, I know who you are.

God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 

Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 

Hey Chef.

Whatever, dude.

Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 

Okay, I'm sorry!

I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.

"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"

I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.

What?

Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.

Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?

Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.

Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??

Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!

Stan.

That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!

Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-

That's worse!

What's awesome?

Dude, he's got Heather!

Whoa, dude, this is a school? 

Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!

Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!

Basketball?

What is this place?

That's it? That's how you did that trick?

Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-

He could be half bear, half manpig.

We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!

Whoa, Christmas snow!

Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.

Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 

He's remembering.

Let's go see a movie! 

Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.

You guys are watchin' murder porn?

I'm gotta get outta here!

Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?

No.

We did it!

Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.

Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus

Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?

Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 

Hang on, Santa! 

Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!

I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.

You guys... don't wanna be around me?

Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.

No Santa, don't!

Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!

This is gonna be so awesome!

Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!

So what should we do?

Huh?

Well... Maybe they'll change.

No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.

Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.

Because our names were called on the commercial last night!

Chef, we're hungry.

Did Kyle know about this?

Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.

Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?

Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 

Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.

Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.

...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.

Come on, people. Come on, people now.

We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.

You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 

Come on, dude!

Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?

Hey Kenny

Help.

Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.

Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.

Oh, then, what's Halloween about?

Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?

What?

Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?

Hello?

Phillip! Phillip!

It is not!

Butters, you're the one doing all this?

So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!

This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.

What are they doing here?

He done killed yer pahr.

Whoa! 

I think we're good.

Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.

Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?

Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.

Uhhh, sh-sure?

Yeah.

We should- 

I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.

No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!

What?!

Oh yeah? I can try! 

Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!

No, I seriously don't want any more friends.

Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.

Our friend, Chef.

No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"

Hit something nice and solid now. 

Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 

What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!

Where are we?

You suck as a best friend, Cartman!

I want a breast!

Yup.

Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!

The what?

When did we do dibs for it?

That's it, that's the whole story?

What are you doing here?

I like it.

to make it spin.

Cartman!

Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?

Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.

Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!

I do? 

Sure.

What is wrong with that guy?

What is that?

Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.

Dude, the commercials could start any time!

Yeah. What's a discharge?

We are making a music video.

No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.

Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!

You got 'em, Marvin.

Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 

Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?

Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger

Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.

Excuse me!

We wanted to see an alien planet or something.

Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!

For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.

You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.

What? 

Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.

See?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

But we don't care!

I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.

Oops.

What?

YOU told me it was a lie!

Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!

He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.

Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 

Ahta! 

No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!

Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.

Yeah dude, it's just shit.

Where? 

We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.

I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!

You suck, Cartman!

The House of Greyhawk?

Where is he now?

That's true.

Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.

Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.

I like it. 

Butters?

Butters! 

I took out the garbage yesterday.

Look! There he is!

Screw this, I gotta get back to work!

No, he didn't!

Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!

Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!

Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.

This is gonna be one looong-ass day. 

The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.

But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!

Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!

I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.

Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.

Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!

Jesus, dude!

Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?

I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.

That's not Kyle's...

Butters was missing?

When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!

Wow!

Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...

Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!

Amazing.

What, Pip?

Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!

Oh, no, nononono.

I think so.

Chef, we just got served.

We've gotta find that ticket!

That'd be cool!

Hey, where's Kyle?

Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!

The kid will never even know.

Don't care. 

No way.

Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?

The... Book of Mormon? What's that?

You just did that to everybody in class!

Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?

Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.

Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

What am I supposed to do about it? 

Butters, what the hell are you doing?

Uh oh, mall cops.

I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?

Sh!

Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.

No.

How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?

Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!

No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.

Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!

Butters!

Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.

They found me!

Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!

Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 

Wow, this is a huge party.

You look a lot better.

Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!

Yeu-bluuuch. 

Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.

I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 

What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?

No, that's too extreme!

So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 

Hey, what's goin' on?

Dad, are you all right?

This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??

Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!

Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!

Yeah.

You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.

What?

Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."

KYLE!! 

Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?

We got it, Dad.

Oh, shit!  Oh!

Hello? Anybody in there? 

Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.

A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!

Yeah, that makes sense.

Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?

But what can I do?

Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.

That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!

Dad, don't get carried away.

We did it, dude, we did it! 

You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.

Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-

Jesus... we have to get out of here. 

We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.

Yeah, alright.

There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!

...K, coming. 

And she's at a hotel in our town. 

...Yeah, screw that bitch.

What the hell?

All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.

Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.

Why?

Juuhachi desu ka? 

Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.

Let go of my face, asshole!

I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.

Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?

Yeah.

Yeah.

What??

Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.

Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.

Well it's just a little messy.

Why?! Don't you know?!

So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.

I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!

Or else what?

Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.

Ugh. Damint.

Ogh..!

The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.

It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?

I'm nine years old.

No, dude!

Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!

This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.

Hooray!

Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?

No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!

Seven and two.

We did it!

Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 

Dude, sweet! 

Too late?! The hell is that?!

Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! 

Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?

We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 

What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!

This rocket will fly to the moon?

Sh!

Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?

Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!

We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!

Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!

We're dead!

Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?

Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.

We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.

What?

The dragon. Where did it go?

You big piece of crap!

What's High School Musical 1 and 2?

"Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!

Why?!

No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.

That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.

Chef!

Can you climb back up, dude?

You're not gonna get away with this! 

Haaa! 

Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.

That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!

What other crime in South Park?

It fell;

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Huh? 

But what do the police do to them?

Yeah!

We're sinking.

Really?

Shut up, Cartman!

Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.

Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.

Super. See you there. 

Hey, look!

Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?

Wow, cool.

You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.

Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.

Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?

Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!

She doesn't have any lips!

Wait, wait, ah I might need those.

What?  Howdy. 

Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.

Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.

Me?! Did you see that shit?!

Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.

Go! Run run run! 

We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.

Who are you?

Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?

Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 

Yeah!

We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.

It fell; I'll try again.

What things??

Where'd you get those?

Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.

Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?

I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.

Dude! We've been waiting forever!

Yeah. Wait, what?

But I didn't write the note!

Yeah, that'd be funny.

What do I have to do?

So what do you suggest?

Dude, what just happened?

That's my silly grampa. 

Oh.

Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.

That's okay with us.

Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!

How much is this going to cost us?

What?! You can't let them do that!

Confession? 

My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.

Wow.

It was my mom's credit card.

Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.

Dude, Kenny!

Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.

Hero-Heroin Hero?

Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.

I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.

Dude, bail! 

Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.

That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?

That does it! Attack! 

So?

Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.

He can't hold it in forever.

Dude.

Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!

...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!

'Scuse me, my name is-

Pst, Cartman.

Hm, that sounds pretty good.

Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!

So what are we gonna do for New Year's?

Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.

I, I guess.

Butters.

Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!

Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.

Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!

Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!

Huh oh. 

Cut! Cartman!

Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.

Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him

Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!

No, that's okay. 

The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.

I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!

What is that?!

But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.

Talked?!

Yeah!

What, Butters?

Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.

Huh?

How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?

We're going upstairs.

Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.

This late?

Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?

I know.

Oh wait, who am I again?

Dude, have you lost more weight?

I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.

Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?

What? 

Let's go. 

Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 

Oooh.

We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!

Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.

Dude, are you okay?

You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?

Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!

Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 

Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?

No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!

Oh Jesus!

Dude, you've got herpes on your face!

...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.

No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.

Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah

Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!

It's all right, Dad.

Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.

Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.

No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!

I'll try again.

That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.

No.

You alright dude?

Where?!

I got it! 

Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!

Come on! 

Jesus?

Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.

Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?

Kenny, you home? 

Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?

Hey, dude, these are good!

Butters? 

Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.

Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..

Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!

But they smell like pee.

Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"

Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...

Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.

Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?

That's impossible!

We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...

Wow!

Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 

Oh, it's just a goat. 

Why not?

Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.

Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 

Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 

Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.

How can you say that looks good?!

Aaah!

Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-

Yeah. 

Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.

Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-

I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!

They're not.

I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.

Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.

But there are no side effects, Chef.

So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?

Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.

Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 

How are we supposed to give them to you?

Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.

This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!

Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!

Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.

I'll try again.

Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.

Dude! Fuck your crops! 

Come on, Cartman, get on.

What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?

Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.

Oh God!

You'll see! We'll get in! 

What??

Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 

Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?

Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!

But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!

W-what did you get in a fight about?

Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 

We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.

Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.

...Shuttle?

What's that?

I'm not gonna kill you grampa.

What is that?

First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!

Indiana Jones! All right! 

Muhammad, are you okay? 

"Fuck you" what?

I don't think we're in a very safe spot.

A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.

We did it! 

No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.

I wanted my job!

...Kenny? Kenny! 

It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!

Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!

Wow, that was short. 

No, it isn't!

Ooooogh.

Well, I'm glad we took care of that.

Kenny?

Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?

Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 

Ya see, Craig? 

Really?

Well, you're mountain lions.

Are we gonna go to hell?

No, they're leaving.

Dude, we totally got let out of school.

Where's Chef?

Hurry up, you guys!

Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. 

They said the gas station outside of town.

...nine, eight...

This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.

Presents.

We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 

Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.

Sup? 

Yeah.

Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 

Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?

Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 

...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!

No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 

This is boring.

You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.

I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.

Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.

Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 

Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.

Well, you might as well let it go.

...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.

No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.

Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.

Dude, do you really have to do it?

Huh?

Sure thing, Bebe.

This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!

...Oh that makes sense.

Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!

Yeah.

Just leave me alone!

Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?

Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?

I think so. 

Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?

Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.

In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!

"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 

You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.

Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 

George Clooney's acceptance speech?

'K.

Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?!

Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."

That's us. Come on.

That was sick, dude!

I'm not done with my pizza.

You can't be serious! You people like this?!

What's going on?

I'm tired, Grandpa.

Presents.

Huh?

No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.

I don't want to shoot the bunny.

Why?

Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.

Where?

Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.

Oh no!

Come on, let's go. 

Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.

You should apologize to Kenny too.

I'll try again.

God this sucks!

What's a - homosexual?

You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.

Where shall we bring it?

Dad, what are you doing?

Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 

Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.

HA!

This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!

Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.

I just think this whole thing is stupid! 

Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-

Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?

I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.

Let him out, dude. He's scared.

Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!

Helen!

Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?

But Mo-o-o-

Mr. Mackey.

Son of a bitch!

Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!

Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!

Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!

You do? 

Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.

...Coats?

She looks pretty hot here.

A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!

Well, where is he?!

Whoa, dude! 

Oh, hey Cartman.

Wow, you remember him?

Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?

Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 

Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.

What, come on, it's not that bad.

Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!

Boy, do I!

Tell us what?!

No, you don't!

Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 

Bo-ring.

Sshh! Cartman!

Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.

More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!

My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.

The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.

All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?

Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?

But Cartman, we're trying to--

Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.

Dude, what happened?? 

Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. 

Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.

Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.

Uh, what?

Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?

I'm good.

Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.

It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.

If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!

We want specific networks dropped from our cable.

Dude. Sh-she's right.

Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 

We just wanna be junior detectives.

Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 

Agh!

Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.

All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!

Whoa!

I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 

Oh, no. 

Well, drop them in! 

Who did?

Yeah, I have to remember that.

Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 

Mom, we didn't mean... 

Oooh- hey, Kenny.

Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.

Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?

Dude...

Hello there, Chef.

I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.

Hey Chef.

Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?

Thetan levels...

All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.

Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.

Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.

The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!

Hey, where's Cartman?

What?

There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.

Who?

Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.

Dude, we just can't tell on them.

I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.

I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

Don't be a smartass?

Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.

Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.

Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!

Jesus! They're gonna kill her!

D'you know John Elway?

Yeah.  War is not my voice.

Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.

Where is our Okama GameSphere?

Hey, what are you doing?! 

Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.

We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.

Cool.

Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 

Go ahead, Kyle, do it.

I know you do, Dad.

Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.

It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!

I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.

No, that's okay.

Come on guys, we might as well go. 

Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?

In the backyard?

Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 

Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.

Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.

I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.

What?!

So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?

Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.

I have?

We have a question.

Hi. Can Token come out and play?

Hey, kid, what are you doing?

Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.

You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.

...No, I don't care about the show.

Man, this sucks.

What's meecrob?

I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.

Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.

Guys, come on! 

All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?

Stop it! It was me! My idea.

Dude, what the hell?

No way! 

That'd be awesome!

Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?

Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!

Cartman!

Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!
You can't!

Is that legal?

Tralalalala

Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.

You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!

I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!

How do we write he note, Cartman?

Dude, what the hell is going in?!

Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.

I just opened an account.

No, dude, we never even saw it!

Oh. 

Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!

What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?

Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.

Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! 

Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!

We don't have any weapons.

Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?

Alright, Dad, I'll add you!

Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!

No, we have to see Kenny!

Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!

Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!

Here they are.

Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?

Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?

Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!

Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 

Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!

You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?

Oh, dude! 

Oh, whatta? 

There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.

We're men.

So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 

I don't care, just hurry! 

They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.

Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?

I believe. 

I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!

Hold on, Cartman!

What??

I don't think they sell those anymore. 

Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.

Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?

Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?

No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.

Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.

Shut up, Cartman!

We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!

I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.

And I say, "Dare!"

The Chosen One?

NO!

I think you're pushing it.

I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 

Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 

Turn it up. 

Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!

"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.

No, you can't even show his feet.

Tralala

to make it spin.

Dude, what happened?

He said, "hi."

Dad? Not now!

Hey, fat ass.

All right, our client will do it!

Yeah!

Pfft whatever.

Me neither.

D'you have lots of gay dogs here?

Hey guys.

All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.

I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.

Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!

But Mr. Twig sucks.

Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.

Really?

If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!

Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!

Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?

Wow, we look great!

All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.

Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.

Dude, what did you make that doll out of?

Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.

So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.

15 agility.

My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.

Oh, you guys!

So this is normal?

I don't believe it.

Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?

You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.

H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!

Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.

He doesn't look very happy in there.

Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!

Tell me about it.

Hoohoo what a dumbass!

Hey, there's some people. 

Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.

I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.

Sweet! 

We're not leaving without Chef.

Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?

Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?

But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?

Yeah!

Yeah?

Yeah?

What?

That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.

No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.

I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 

Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.

Tweek?

I thought you guys were sick! 

No, dude, we really, really do.

Really? That's great.

Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?

Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.

What?

...Hey, you can't do that!

Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?

Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 

But Wendy, we don't understand how that-

That doesn't make sense! 

Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?

But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.

There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.

Why don't we just tell our parents?

What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?

Haha! You lose, fatass!

Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.

Wow, he died.

Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?

...What the fuck?!

Let's watch something else.

Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 

I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."

Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!

We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.

Um, I'm not really prepared either.

Oh ooh.

You'd better not be lying, Kenny. 

See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."

Aww, do I have to?

It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 

Hike!

Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."

Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.

For what?

There has to be a way!

But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?

Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.

But are you back for good?

Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.

Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?

It does work!!

What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?

Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!

This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 

Dad?

You can say that again.

Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 

...Okay. I'll vote.

Huh?

Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!

No.

He made it down. 

And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"

Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.

Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 

I know.

We can fix this!

Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?

You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.

Ddue, we have to try.

Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.

But you-your face!

Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.

Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?

I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.

No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.

Yes, dude!

Is this hunting?

They're after you! 

I've got ADD.

In Minecraft.

Snowball! 

Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?

Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!

Damn it!

Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.

You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 

There, how does that look?

I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 

Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 

Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?

Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.

Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!

Wa-was it wearing clothes?

No, we're friends.

Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.

Okay.  One.

Leave me alone grampa. 

Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!

You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.

Come on! We're going to his house! 

Then stop being mad!

Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!

What?

Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 

Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! 

Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls

Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.

I wasn't talking about spaghetti. 

Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 

Not here! Go further away!

No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 

Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 

We're on like, some foreign planet.

I just wanted my period.

We don't know. 

Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!

Mr. Mackey, stop running!

Uh. We've been taking care of him.

Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 

I'm just a-scared of snakes.

Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.

We'll see about that!

Stop! Stop! 

All right Jesus!

Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 

Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!

Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!

We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 

Oh my God!

Huh?

Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!

Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 

Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.

I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 

But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.

Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.

Yes?

Dad! You've gotta help me! 

Yeah, we need condoms!

What the hell does that mean?

Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!

Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!

Cartman, dude, what's wrong?

Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.

I saw it this way!

Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 

It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.

Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!

We won, dude!

Do I really have to do this, Dad?

Ahhh, bicycles?

Killer! Thanks, Chef.

Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!

...Dad, you are my friend.

I don't know about this Chef.

Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 

Aw come on.

I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. 

Yeah, maybe you're right. 

Why?

My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.

We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.

Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.

I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.

Wh-why?

Yeah.

We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 

Dad, nobody's gonna come.

What are you gloating about?

Hey, Kenny.

...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.

I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.

Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.

Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 

Well what's wrong with it?

She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.

Excuse me?

Yeah.

That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 

Man, the bus sure is late.

It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?

But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.

...That makes perfect sense, Butters.

No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.

Do you think they're happy?

It fell;

He'd better!

He just... ignited.

Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.

He's just confused.

No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.

Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things

No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.

Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!

Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!

It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 

Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 

...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...

What'd they say?

You did, Jesus. 

You said "hand over the bunny."

Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!

I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!

Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!

How do you know?

Yeah.

Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!

Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!

...Yeah?

I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.

Cartman!

Yea, please!

But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 

I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.

Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?

Do you see the sea people.

I think something might be wrong with Dad?

Cartman, no! 

Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?

Do you have our Okama GameSphere?

If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?

Hundred bucks, no big whoop.

So do you know anything that can help him?

I can't do it, dude.

But they kill people.

Naturally.

Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?

Wait a minute. Cartman?! 

I just, my dad was-

Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!

Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.

What?! Why?

She has to! 

Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.

Hey that's right. We need a ringer. 

The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.

No, this is exactly what we wanted.

It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.

I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.

Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)

Detective McCormick found something interesting. 

Tango, Tango, I'm in position.

Stem cells?

Cartman's?

Ahah

Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.

Uuuuh...

Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.

My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.

Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.

Hey, hey! What are you doing?!

Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! 

Guys, you're okay!

We wanna talk to Chef.

You're not?

The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.

What?

Yeah, you damn kids!

Whoa whoa, Cartman.

Hey!  Wait a minute!

Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.

All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.

Okay, where to next?

You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.

Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.

Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.

Aughah. 

So, how far is it to Nebraska?

We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!

That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?

What are you going to do with it, dude?

Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.

No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!

Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. 

Damn, dude.

Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 

Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.

But we don't even care about the rainforest.

Are you guys fucking serious?

But it isn't supposed to end like this!

Oh.

You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?

It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.

Aww! Not those guys again! 

Wait, that's it?

Ohh, dude, get me out of here!

His... name... is... Gorak!

Oh hey, there's Token. 

I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!

Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 

Whoa, dude!

You didn't know that?

Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?

This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.

No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?

Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.

Hey, yeah!

Ow!

Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

Television? 

to make it spin.

Dude, this is creepy.

All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!

You bastards!

All right dude, get in his bed.

Nobody has any ideas?

Can we get a different pose, please? 

Yeah.

We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.

Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 

Hey, be careful in there.

What do we do now?

Uh oh.

Jesus, you did answer my prayer! 

Oh, nice going, Cartman!

Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?

Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 

Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 

Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.

Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.

No, we'll use it.

What happened??

Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.

AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 

Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!

* I told you, fatass.

Totally dude.

How come you wanna help the fatass?!

I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.

Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.

My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.

Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!

It's all right, dad.

You guys. You guys, wake up! 

That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 

Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!

Why?

Where's Kenny??

No i wouldn't.

Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. 

But it's just crap.

Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.

Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.

Agh.

Help me chip some of the ice away.

We're going as fast as we can!

Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!

Yeah, he looks terrible.

Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?

Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.

What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.

Hello?

H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.

What's in the box, dude?

Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.

Oh my God, what's going on?

Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 

Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 

Well dude, what are we supposed to do?

No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.

I can't see, dude!

Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.

Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!

Man...

Okay, there. 

Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?

I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.

Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.

I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 

What's going on? 

Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.

Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?

Goddammit, dude, I don't know.

Yeah, it was weak.

We want three tickets to the North Pole. 

Aaanh, he does this all the time.

Are they good?

Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 

Okay, grab the sled. 

Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!

What's "The Contender"?

Really??

Uh... I'm eight?

Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!

All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.

Yeah, Timmy ruhules!

Great! 

Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 

For nothing.

Deal, druggie!

Huh??

Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?

Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?

Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.

Why not?!

It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.

What?

Yeah.

Damn.

Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.

Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 

Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.

I'll try

They're here! Hurry and hide! 

Oh no!

Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-

NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.

I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!

I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.

Jesus Christ...

Dude, it's the freak nurse!

Come on, Cartman. 

Oh no.

Why do dogs have cold noses?

No, Dad, people will see!

Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!

What? Who-who is this?

We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?

Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.

CHEF!

Wow, is that from Origins?

Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.

Butters, is there any way out of here?

Sh. Here they come. 

Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.

Okay.

Really.

Wow, that's amazing.

Yeah, I guess so. 

You really think he'll die in Somalia?

How much?

Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 

Yeah! 

Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?

You mean,you're a ginger?

Liver medicine?

What the hell are they doing now?

Like what?

Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.

We need you to promise not to tell anybody.

Dude, I'm not going.

Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?

Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!

Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 

Ow!

That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.

Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.

Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!

Come on, let's go get to the plane. 

And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.

We could?

What?

Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.

You know what it is?

I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.

You guys, we're gonna lose our client. 

Aw man! 

...I don't know where I belong...

That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!

Boy, this is the life, huh guys?

Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!

We've come to... ask you for help.

You're talking about Butters.

So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.

Hey Kyle.

We, we got it. 

This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.

Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.

Cartman, tell us.

...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.

Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 

Oh my God! Look! 

We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.

Okay, the time has finally come. 

Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.

Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 

Yes!

Butters, what the hell are you doing?

This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 

The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 

Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'

I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.

Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.

Dude.

You?

Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 

Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. 

Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!

Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 

The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 

The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.

We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.

Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.

Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!

Ahta? 

Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?

Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 

Awww!

Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.

Yes, Mr. Garrison.

No dude, you're a douche.

But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.

Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!

We showed the shocking footage to the principal!

No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.

Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?

What what do I do?

Yeah.

You had head lice?

Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.

See? My dad is the coolest after all.

Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.

Oh, boy.

Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.

Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?

Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 

We got you covered, Timmy.

When you shoot the puck to another player.

Dude, where is she? We can't wait.

I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.

Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.

There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.

On a boat! That wasn't mine!

You all right?

This is stupid.

Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.

No!

Aghh!

Wait. What's going on here? 

It's not gonna work; just come down from there.

We don't care.

...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.

Hawaii?

Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.

We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 

Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?

This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'

No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!

Yeah.

But then, why does God give us anything to start with?

I know, but uh-... but...

You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!

There's fags everywhere!

Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!

Oh no! 

Hey, what the hell!

Dude, come on!

Can you do it again?

Gah, let's go you guys. 

All right, fine, go ahead.

Damnit! And we thought we were so original!

How do you know?!

What is this all about, Kyle?

The hell's going on now?!

Screw this! Turn hard to port! 

Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.

Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?

Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 

Yeah.

Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?

Okay I'll be your friend.

Chef!! 

So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?

You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 

Quick, call Kyle.

Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!

Yeah.  Where are you guys going?

We did it! We did it!

That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.

It's starting, it's starting!

Kyle?

My God!

HaaAAAA! 

Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Well, so much for our money.

Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...

You did? 

We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.

Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!

Fine!

Just bread...

I'll bet you can.

To Los Angeles?

That's a haiku?

Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 

Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!

Wendy! 

That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?

What was his point?

Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.

That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.

Come on!

Craig's new show?

...Craig's show??

Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?

Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.

Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.

Oh boy.

Tell him we're busy.

I.

This is hopeless!

Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.

Yeah, I know.

Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.

Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?

You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!

Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!

Why does that matter?

Let's get out of here! 

Yeah?

Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?

I know! Let's go sledding!

No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 

What?

Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.

We, just came to ask a question.

And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.

He's what?? 

Well are you gonna tell your dad?

Yeah!

Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?

It was all planned out!

I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!

I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.

Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!

Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.

Two thousand dollars.

You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!

'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell? 

Aaaaaagh!

They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.

Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 

Closed?

How do you feel, Butters?

What?!

Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!

Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!

Oh, no! They got Chef, too!

I'm in.

Can you leave the light on, Dad?

Chef, we did something kind of bad.

No, he didn't.

Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.

It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.

What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.

They aren't leaving.

What's going on? Are we in trouble?

Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.

It's... nice.

Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.

Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.

Yeah, let us go!

You would think that, you little ass-sucker.

Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?

We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.

It's... it's the greatest show of all time.

Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.

Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.

Stan.

I think we have to signal them somehow.

Milkshakes?!

...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.

I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.

Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 

Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.

Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.

I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.

Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!

I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.

Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.

Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.

Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?

Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.

Hoh!

...Like ...money? What?

Stop right there, you little rat!

It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!

Yeah, my goldfish-.

Is Bebe home?

No... NOOO!!

No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.

Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.

What is that?

Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?

What?

Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!

Sweet.

Hiya, Sparky.

And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.

Who's Karen Carpenter?

Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.

Boy, I'll say!

Hello?

No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!

Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!

Who are you?

Hey! So what are you going to do now?

Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.

We sit.

Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!

Come on Cartman!

Uh...

Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.

I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.

It's gotta be our turn soon.

But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.

Yeah, stupid.

Dude, they're never gonna let us through.

Uh, no! I hate that toy!

He's taking swimming lessons.

We brought Christmas to Iraq!

Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.

Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 

What?? 

Woof.

Dad? What the hell is going on?

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.

Aww, Goddammit!

This is gonna be so funny!

...'K.

No, uhno, not finkleroy.

Dad.  Good luck.

Well, we tried, dude.

Token sings?

Woohoo!

We're working on it.

Dude, it's over. He's gone.

The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.

What's that stuff?

You're just saying that, Cartman.

Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?

Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?

What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?

This is going great!

Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 

I never said I was.

I think Verizon.

Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 

Why is that funny?

And that has something to do with their medicines because...?

Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.

No, that's Kenny.

Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!

You're not number two!

Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!

This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!

Butters is totally fine with it, dude.

What?

Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?

Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.

That's your dad?

Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.

Wow!

Okay okay, take the form of something else!

Just the news.

Well, let's dig 'er up! 

So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?

Can't believe we have to go to school!

Goddamn, that took a long time.

We made a promise... to Jesus! 

I know, right?! 

Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!

Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?

What? You guys are aliens?

I haven't been sleeping well.

Who's Captain Hindsight?

Did you go yet?

No wait. 

There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!

Yeah, it's pretty weird. 

Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?

If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.

So how did I do?

He's not done for, he's standing right there.

Yeah!

The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 

I have to give him half my stuff?

Huh? 

Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.

Huh?

Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 

I don't know. He's such a wuss.

Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!

You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. 

Can't this thing go any faster?

They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!

Over two hundred bucks.

Dude, you're not gonna believe this.

"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"

Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.

Stop it! I didn't do anything!

Oh wow...

Oh God!

The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.

What the hell are you doing?!

Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.

That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?

I wouldn't care.

Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!

Alright, let's go see what he wants. 

That was the longest day of school ever!

They can't say "shit" on television!

What?

Guys. Look. 

Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.

Dammit, we lost one already!

I don't... I don't know.

You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!

What, dude?

You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.

How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!

But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.

What are you talking about?

Yeah.

You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 

Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.

Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!

No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.

All right, sorry guys. So where to now?

A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.

Dad, it's not that big a deal.

Wow.

What are these? They're Chinpokomon!

What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.

Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.

The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.

Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!

What?

Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.

Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.

Hi Shelly.

How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?

Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.

Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 

It's not?

I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--

No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!

Dude, I'm almost dead.

No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.

Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.

What are you talking about?

Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.

It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.

Ohhh, fuck it!

Because I had an itch up my ass.

Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!

What?

I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?

Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.

My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!

What?!

What?

Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 

Yeah. I told you that!

A hook.

We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.

Did you hear anything more about what happened?

That's not me, that's you!

Super weak.

No, I'm done with that! 

I have no idea.

Suckup.

No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.

Okay. We're done.

Gorak!

And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.

Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.

We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!

Well why did you have to involve me??

Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?

Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!

Sure was, Dad.

No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.

The rock creatures?

I'm not voting!

Don't touch me. 

We did it! We did it!

You're leaving already?

Dude, shut up!

'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.

Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.

No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 

Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?

Are you ready grampa?

Yeah. It's cool, holmes.

No, uh, it just explains a lot.

Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.

Kyle! Kyle!

She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!

No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.

Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?

All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.

See? You sound like a dick.

We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.

All prepared for liposuction surgery?

What, Cartman? What's happened?

Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. 

My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 

Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.

It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 

Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.

Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.

You know, "they."

Whoopee!

Over here!  Jump down! Go! 

Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.

...well but... but that's my money.

No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.

Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.

Let's just do this, all right? 

Exactly! People don't even know where it is.

Can I do it?

They're not together anymore, dude.

I know.

Catch what?

No way.

No.

Nnnothing, nothing.

Bluuch. Kick ass!

Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 

Kyle, what were you thinking?

Tell me what you wrote about!

Right.

A little more gas, Kenny. 

Thanks for your help, Wendy.

No, we just fake it to shut him up.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Can you hit a target, Pip?

Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 

Pizza... pizza... pizza...

Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.

She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.

Where's dad?

Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.

Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.

Yeah, we did. 

Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.

Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?

Dude, I don't get it.

No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.

What you assholes acted like you were doing? 

So? You can poo in the wilderness.

Who's Joseph Smith? 

Come on, nobody's gonna notice.

It... kind of sounds like shit.

His a-miracles?

Oh man, this is another rerun.

My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.

God dammit!

Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.

Thanks Kyle.

That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.

Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.

Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!

We did it. 

Well?

I know, Mom. I love you too.

It's all right, just a scratch.

Hello?

But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!

to make it spin.

Yeah, dude, it's all yours.

No, I mean, kill my grampa.

Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.

Oh shit!

Go to hell, Cartman!

Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.

That's really, really terrible, dude.

So dude, did Cartman's idea work?

We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.

Aha! 

What's a "tooth trade?"

Because my dad's an idiot!

You mean like a baker and a cop?

Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!

Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on! 

Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.

Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 

Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?

This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!

No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!

We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 

...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!

Hello? Can anybody hear me?

Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. 

Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-

Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!

No.

Heather? 

Because we're on Ritalin.

Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.

Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.

We thought you were in jail.

Stop. 

Hey Wendy, what's a dildo? 

Yes I do.

I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.

Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.

Aaah! Snake!

Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.

Cartman??

Dude, why are you so into their relationship?

Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.

Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?

Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.

Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?

Yes, now get out of here.

Hey look!

Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...

For one tooth?

What does he mean, "living in denial"?

Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.

Grandpa's in it too?

Hey, can they do that??

I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.

We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!

Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.

Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.

Yeah.

Hooray!

Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!

How do you feel?

Oh no... 

Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!

Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.

I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.

Sso then we win?

All right, I'm turning around

Ummm, where did you get that picture?

So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.

Okay. 

Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 

Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?

Ohhh hey guys.

You can't stay here.

Yeah.

Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!

There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.

Sick!

What's going on??

What do you mean?

I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.

And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.

Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!

Bad.

Nah.

I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!

I know! 

Where are you going?

Aww crap.

What?

Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...

Take that you stupid Indian! 

When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!

Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.

Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?

Dude, I don't understand this game at all.

Dude, not cool. This is scary. 

Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!

What about him?

Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 

If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?

Awww!

There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.

Move out of the way.

My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!

Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!

What? He did.

That's not your mom calling!

AGGGGGGHHHHHH!

Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.

Look, there's the F-word.

Yeah.

Okay, what have you got?

Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!

Uuh, you'll see.

They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.

What is he saying?

That was beautiful, dude.

I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!

Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.

But you didn't die?

What the...&#160;?

There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 

Are they playing basketball? 

Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.

Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.

Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 

It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.

Really?  People who are doing something?

Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?

No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 

All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 

No, a double cheeseburger and fries!

So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.

Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.

Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.

What? 

Kyle! Kyle!

Jesus Christ!

Blockbuster Video?

Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.

Alright! 

Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?

Where am I supposed to go?

That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.

I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.

What?!

Wow, this is happening so fast.

What do we want?

Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?

They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 

Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 

Oh, really??

Kyle! 

Who's this?

Dude, we don't have any musical talent.

You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.

You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.

Go on, dude it's the only way.

Crab people?

I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 

That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?

You said we're free to leave whenever we want

What word could we make up?

How?

No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.

What would Jesus do?  Yeheah! 

How?!

Wull, maybe he won't fight.

How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 

And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 

Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.

Jesus, why does God hate me?

Jesus, Cartman!

It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.

Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?

I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?

You doing okay, Ms. Spears? 

Dad, what are you doing?!

Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 

Okay, here he comes. 

Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!

We... don't... care.

Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.

God!

Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.

Aw crap, Dad! 

Chef, you have to dump the bitch!

Oh brother.

Kyle!

Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.

No!  A dead body.

Ah, hey, Bebe.

No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.

It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 

You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.

Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.

Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?

Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.

Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 

Hey, that was easy!

I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.

Hoh hoh hoh!

I can't see. 

Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!

Come on, Tweek! You got him!

My family's dead! 

What's that?

Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!

Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!

How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.

No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.

Pretty good. We're almost done.

So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?

How 'bout some ice cream?

Oh no, dude.

Wugh! Two weeks of this!

"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.

Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.

Almost.

Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?

Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!

Okay, thanks, Towelie. 

If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??

But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.

I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 

Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"

I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!

So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." 

Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?

...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-

What?

Do you think animals can be murderers, too?

Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!

Son of a bitch!

Do I have to?

Aw crap. 

Wait, what is that?  Dude!

Try to do what you wanna do!

Stop!

We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.

Yeah Dad. You need some of this. 

It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.

Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.

Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!

Dad? Dad?

Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.

Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?

Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.

Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!

I feel... different.

Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?

I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.

Daaaad!

Aaaah!

Dude.

Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?

I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!

No.

We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.

Nothing.  Hey, kid!

The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 

Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 

I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 

What are you talking about, dude?!

What seems pointless?

Let me see your iPad, Cartman.

He's definitely lost it

Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!

Aw, dude, why would they do that?

Not today... yet.

Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?

No! No! 

We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!

What the fuck?

We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.

Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!

Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 

So what should we do? 

Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!

Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.

Tells?

Right, so how do we get back at them?

What is this place?

I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

Dad!

A what?

Pick me up. I... I want to see. 

I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?

What do we do with it?

True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.

Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?

Ugh.

Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.

Base! 

Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 

Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-

They did.

We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!

Oh, hell!

Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.

Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?

We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!

Yeah, it's not bad. Next? 

Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.

Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?

I guess so.

Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 

Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.

Really?

Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 

I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?

Leave me alone!!

What's the matter?

What?

Heh hey wait a minute dude.

When do we want it?

Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!

Aw, come on, Mom.

Dude, this isn't right.

That's gay. 

Yeah, who cares?

I don't believe it.

Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-

Celery?

Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.

Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?

Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!

You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
