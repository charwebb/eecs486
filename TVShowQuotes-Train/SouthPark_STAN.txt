Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
I don't believe that he's my future self!
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Dude, is he here every year like this?
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
I know, but you don't tell him that!
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
What the hell do you want from me?! 
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
Well you have to convince them they are real!
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
We all have to do this report together, dude.
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
But I don't understand why we have to--
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
...and then we put them back in the tank.
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
What am I supposed to do about it? 
We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
I know we can lose if we try.
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
How can they even call that a movie?
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
All right, we just need one more person!
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
Help me chip some of the ice away.
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
I think something might be wrong with Dad?
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 
Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Could you just hand us some food please?
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
You guys, we just wanna know if you-
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
Come on, you guys! This is our town!
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
So I can return it to a bank?
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
We're just going in to get our video game back.
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Because I had an itch up my ass.
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
How much do we get if we work for you?
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
So do you know anything that can help him?
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
Come on guys, we might as well go. 
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
What are we supposed to do with it?
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
Dude, how long has your future self been around?
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
It might hold the key to a curse.
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
Well why did you have to involve me??
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
When you shoot the puck to another player.
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
I have to give him half my stuff?
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
(I don't think I like this new law.)
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
Could you pull over so I can get out?
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
W-what did you get in a fight about?
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
Dude, do you really have to do it?
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
You mean like a baker and a cop?
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
We might pass him off as our pet.
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
But, how do they get away with that?
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Do you think he can ride the bull?
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
That's probably okay if you spread it out.
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Right, so how do we get back at them?
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
But I don't know any of this stuff.
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
Is this for real?? This is for real!
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
Something I should have done a long time ago. 
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
But you all thought our name was sweet.
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 
How are we supposed to give them to you?
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
But what do the police do to them?
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
They said the gas station outside of town.
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
And who do we have on our side?
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
I just wanna find something else to play.
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
How much is this going to cost us?
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
Well, you might as well let it go.
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
That was the longest day of school ever!
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
What? How do you know she has a cat? 
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
A way to finally do something good for other people.
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
And she's at a hotel in our town. 
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
I... said it would really bum them out.
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
Do you think they should change the flag?
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
How do you guys make them so yummy?
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
You just did that to everybody in class!
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
All right, so how do I join you?
My parents will never let me keep a goat
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
He's really got it out for you, dude.
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
No, I don't think either of us can. 
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
I don't know what the hell that is...
What do you think happens if you do have it?
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
Butters, is there any way out of here?
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
I took them to see how abortions are done.
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
