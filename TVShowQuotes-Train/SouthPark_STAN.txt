I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.
Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
W-what did you get in a fight about?
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
How much is this going to cost us?
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
I think something might be wrong with Dad?
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
...and then we put them back in the tank.
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Help me chip some of the ice away.
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
"On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
We're just going in to get our video game back.
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." 
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
So now we are in th real world.
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
What are we supposed to do with it?
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
When you shoot the puck to another player.
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
So I can return it to a bank?
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
I just wanna find something else to play.
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
So do you know anything that can help him?
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
You mean like a baker and a cop?
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
How do you guys make them so yummy?
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Is this for real?? This is for real!
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
No, I don't think either of us can. 
Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
Butters, is there any way out of here?
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
But what do the police do to them?
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
My parents will never let me keep a goat
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
But I don't know any of this stuff.
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
How can they even call that a movie?
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
Well, you might as well let it go.
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
A way to finally do something good for other people.
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
I don't know what the hell that is...
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
He's really got it out for you, dude.
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
What are you going to do with it, dude?
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
Dude, is he here every year like this?
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. 
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
Could you pull over so I can get out?
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
All right, so how do I join you?
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
What the hell do you want from me?! 
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Well you have to convince them they are real!
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
We all have to do this report together, dude.
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
It might hold the key to a curse.
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
Something I should have done a long time ago. 
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Well why did you have to involve me??
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
"Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
How much do we get if we work for you?
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
That's probably okay if you spread it out.
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 
Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
But, how do they get away with that?
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
But I don't understand why we have to--
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
"Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. 
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
That was the longest day of school ever!
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
They said the gas station outside of town.
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
(I don't think I like this new law.)
If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
What do you think happens if you do have it?
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
We might pass him off as our pet.
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
All right, we just need one more person!
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
You guys, we just wanna know if you-
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
What am I supposed to do about it? 
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
And she's at a hotel in our town. 
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
I took them to see how abortions are done.
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
But you all thought our name was sweet.
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
You just did that to everybody in class!
This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
I... said it would really bum them out.
No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Could you just hand us some food please?
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
I know, but you don't tell him that!
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
Dude, how long has your future self been around?
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
What? How do you know she has a cat? 
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
How are we supposed to give them to you?
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Do you think they should change the flag?
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." 
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
I don't believe that he's my future self!
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Come on, you guys! This is our town!
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Come on guys, we might as well go. 
No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
