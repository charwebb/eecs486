Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!

Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 

I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 

Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 

Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?

Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!

You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!

My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.

Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.

I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.

We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!

Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!

Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.

Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-

Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 

Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?

Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. 

That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?

What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!

Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?

AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!

Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!

Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.  Oooh, now I see the resemblance!

But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!

We sssure did go through a lot together.

Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?

Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!

Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!

Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 

That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 

Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 

Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?

I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.

You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!

Okay, but we still won't stand for this!

Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 

It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 

That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 

Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?

Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.

Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?

Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?

We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!

Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 

You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!

You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 

Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?

That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!

My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.

Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!

Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. 

Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. 

Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?

Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.

AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!

No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?

Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?

Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?

Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?

Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?

Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner.

Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.

Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 

And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!

Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 

Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.

Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 

Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 

Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.

Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!

Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? 

Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.

But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!

We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?

I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?

Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.

I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?

Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?

He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.

Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.

It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!

Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.

Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!

What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 

Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.

Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.

Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.

She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!

That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 

Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
