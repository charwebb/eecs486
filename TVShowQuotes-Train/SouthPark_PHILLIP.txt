Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 
That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 
Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 
Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.
Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 
AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 
Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?
It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 
Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 
Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!
Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.
We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. 
Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!
Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 
Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!
Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 
Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?
No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?
Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 
Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?
We sssure did go through a lot together.
We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!
I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 
Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? 
Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.  Oooh, now I see the resemblance!
Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 
Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?
Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner.
Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 
That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.
Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.
Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 
I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. 
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. 
What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 
My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.
Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
