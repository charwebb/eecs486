What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.
Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. 
Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 
Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 
My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 
Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?
Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!
Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 
Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. 
Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.
She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 
My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.
I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?
That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?
Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 
Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?
I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 
Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?
Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
We sssure did go through a lot together.
I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 
You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 
Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.
Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 
Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? 
Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?
We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!
Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.
That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. 
That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 
That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 
Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner.
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 
Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
