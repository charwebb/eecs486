Yeah, whatever, kid.

Waitwait. Hunh.

May we come in, please?

Beelzeboot!

I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 

But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!

Behold his horrible face!

Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!

Killing is never an accident, you dickface! 

Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?

Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 

Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 

Hey, don't give me cancer! 

Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?

Who the fuck is that?

What are you doing, Scott?

AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!

Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?

Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. 

Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?

Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?

What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 

I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.

Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.

Cancer?

Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?

Yes Terrance?

What?

Well, don't fart on me Terrance.

Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?

That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?

...after these messages. 

Terrance, I-

'Cause you're a dick?

No, we're searching for treasure.

Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!

AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!

You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!

Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!

O Ca-nadaOur home and native land

Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!

Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 

It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!

NO, I'm asking you his name!

Hello Barky. Hello Purry.

What?

Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.

Terrance...

Not as fat as your face!

My ass is collapsing?

Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. 

She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!

Ohh, the humanity!!

Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. 

Maybe you can go live with the Danish!

Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!

No, I'm Phillip!

How do you like that, Terrance?

Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?

I'm not your friend, buddih!

You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 

That's right! We've come to kill you! 

And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!

Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 

Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.

This is madness!

We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!

We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!

Wow, that sucks. 

Aww. sick! 

Look at their silly American heads.

We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?

Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?

Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 

Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 

Aaaaagh!

Who's the donor?

Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!

Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.

Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.

What?

Oh God, you're smelly!

Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?

Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?

Oh, what is it? 

That's sick!

You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!

Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.

He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.

Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 

Oh, Terrance! You farted in court!

What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!

Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!

That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 

That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.

Why not? 

Oh, Glorious Day!

Oh, you farted. 

My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.

That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 

But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!

Now he's a smelly Indian. 

You're exactly right Terrance. Oh. 

I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.

It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 

Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television.

Do you really think that would help?

I do, Terrance. 

Oh no, hahahahahahaha.

For Canada, Terrance. 

Wait, what were you saying?

Because you're goddamn ugly... 

Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?

Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.

We sssure did go through a lot together.

Yes, please.

So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!

The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.

What is this? 

I sure would Terrance.

Yes. I agree whole-fartedly. 

Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.

Ahhh 

You're right. It's a better one, asshole!

My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.

What do you mean?

That's tomfoolery. 

Goddamn, their TV shows are lame! 

Oh, look. There she is. .

Cancer??

Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.

Burned your face.

That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 

Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!

Hello, Ugly Bob.

Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!

Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.

Whatever. Where's my check? 

Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.

Then I'll go with you, Terrance.

Okay, waitwait waitwait. 

Ooh, Terrannce!  You got a letterr!

Really? Let me take a look.

Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?

Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.

Tell him he's a smelly bastard.

Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!

Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.

Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.

Oh. 

Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!

Excuse me, buddy.

Take that you stupid dick.

Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!

It's just the way things are going?

Hear hear!

I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?

Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?

Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 

I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?

He's not your friend, guy!

Okay, but we still won't stand for this!

The monkey claw is smelly.

You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!

Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 

Yes. Prepare the alert!

Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?

Well, all right. 

All right, Terrance. 

Look closer.  Closer.  Hunh-nh.

Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob.

Hey Terrance, I think I have a-

Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?

That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. 

No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?

I'll take that.

Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 

What's happening here, Terrance?

Waitwaitwaitwait. 

Oh God, he just doesn't stop!

What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?

Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?

Oh look. Here's a show. 

No Terrance, why don't you tell me?

Ah, a squeaker!

Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 

What? 

Oho yeah, I love beans.

Cancer?!!

What the hell is this disgusting crap?!

Give it to me straight, Terrance.

You mean, we are to blame?!

You're such an asshole, Terrance.

What's HE doing here?

Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.

That's better. 

God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!

Oh, what a relief!

Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?
