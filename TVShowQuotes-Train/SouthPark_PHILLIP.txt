Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?

Hey, don't give me cancer! 

Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.

This is madness!

Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.

What?

Ohh, the humanity!!

Yes. I agree whole-fartedly. 

That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 

I do, Terrance. 

Ah, a squeaker!

Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.

Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 

That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. 

How do you like that, Terrance?

Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 

Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 

You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!

Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television.

Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!

I have, haven't I, Terrance? 

Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 

It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 

Oh, Glorious Day!

Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?

Yeah, whatever, kid.

Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?

God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!

What do you mean?

For Canada, Terrance. 

The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.

All right, Terrance. 

Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!

What?

Who's the donor?

And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!

Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?

My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.

That's tomfoolery. 

Hello Barky. Hello Purry.

Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?

Then I'll go with you, Terrance.

Cancer?!!

Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.

Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.

Burned your face.

Goddamn, their TV shows are lame! 

That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 

...after these messages. 

Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 

Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.

I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.

No, we're searching for treasure.

AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!

Oh? Does it run on electricity?

Hey Terrance, I think I have a-

May we come in, please?

What the hell is this disgusting crap?!

Maybe you can go live with the Danish!

He's not your friend, guy!

Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!

We sssure did go through a lot together.

Oh look. Here's a show. 

Oh no, hahahahahahaha.

I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?

AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!

'Cause you're a dick?

Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.

Oh, Terrance! You farted in court!

Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.

Do you really think that would help?

Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?

Take that you stupid dick.

What is this? 

Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.

Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!

Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?

Waitwaitwaitwait. 

Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 

Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. 

Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. 

Now he's a smelly Indian. 

Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?

O Ca-nadaOur home and native land

Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?

Give it to me straight, Terrance.

Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-

Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.

Whatever. Where's my check? 

It wasn't me! 

Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?

That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!

It's just the way things are going?

We're not? 

But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!

Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? 

Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!

What are you doing, Scott?

Because you're goddamn ugly... 

Killing is never an accident, you dickface! 

I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 

Oh, what a relief!

Oh, you farted. 

Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 

Look at their silly American heads.

What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 

Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.

Oh, there's one. 

Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.

Not as fat as your face!

No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?

So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!

That's sick!

Yes. Prepare the alert!

Wow, that sucks. 

Wait, what were you saying?

Beelzeboot!

Aaaaagh!

Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner.

Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. 

Okay, waitwait waitwait. 

But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!

Oh, look. There she is. .

Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!

Yes, let's look for treasure.

Cancer?

Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!

Oh. 

Hello, Ugly Bob.

You're right. It's a better one, asshole!

Cancer??

Waitwait. Hunh.

No Terrance, why don't you tell me?

Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 

You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!

What's HE doing here?

Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?

We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?

Okay.

My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.

That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?

Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?

Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.

What?

Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!

Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.

Oh God, he just doesn't stop!

Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?

Here's a man's fart for ya. 

Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?

Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?

I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?

Yes?

He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.

Really? Let me take a look.

Well, don't fart on me Terrance.

Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?

Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!

Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 

We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!

What? 

Oh God, you're smelly!

You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!

What's happening here, Terrance?

Yes Terrance?

She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!

That's better. 

I'm not your friend, buddih!

That's right! We've come to kill you! 

Terrance, I-

Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.

Well, all right. 

You mean, we are to blame?!

Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. 

Oho yeah, I love beans.

Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob.

It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!

Okay, but we still won't stand for this!

Tell him he's a smelly bastard.

Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!

NO, I'm asking you his name!

Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 

Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.

Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.

You're exactly right Terrance. Oh. 

That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 

Aww. sick! 

Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.

What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?

Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 

Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!

Ooh, Terrannce!  You got a letterr!

Yes, please.

Who the fuck is that?

My ass is collapsing?

No, I'm Phillip!

That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 

Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.

Oh, what is it?
