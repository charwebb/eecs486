Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 
Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 
She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!
It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 
What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 
Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?
We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!
Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 
Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?
That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 
Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?
Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 
My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 
Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner.
Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. 
But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 
Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.  Oooh, now I see the resemblance!
Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 
I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 
Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 
You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 
My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.
AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
We sssure did go through a lot together.
I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 
Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? 
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.
Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.
Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 
Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. 
Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?
Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!
It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 
That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
