What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.
You seem like you want to tell me something.
Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?
It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
No, you said I was a good person...
Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.
Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.
No, not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.)
Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.
