Ned?
...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
That's my mother.
Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.
Yeah.
Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!
Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
How can you say that?
Stuart.
Right.
No, there's no resemblance.
Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)
Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
Elaine, I was adopted.
What?
What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics.
I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic.
So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?
Bad bad association?
D-Deon Rifkin?
Sure?
(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already!
NO, NO. COME ON!
All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.
I mean, youre my best friend.
Hey.
O.K. you got your list?
(crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
Alex.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Deon Benes?
I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
Elaine! What is going on?
Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan...
Is there a real bird in the back?
He asked me if I still saw you. I said, Sure, I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)
After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.
So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?
Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?
I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, Im your biggest fan!
Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.
Howard Metro.
Do you really want me to go?
Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.
NEXT!
Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.
Didnt mean what?
Stu--Stuart's no good?
(from the hallway) Kramer.
Massaging your neck.
What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
O.K.
You know, I should really try something like that.
