Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.
What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics.
Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already!
I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.
(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
He asked me if I still saw you. I said, Sure, I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)
(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.
You know, I should really try something like that.
M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?
Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)
After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.

Is there a real bird in the back?
I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic.
Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan...
...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday.
So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
