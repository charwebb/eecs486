I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, Im your biggest fan!
Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!
Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.
Is there a real bird in the back?
Sure?
Ned?
(crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
Deon Benes?
(from the hallway) Kramer.
You know, I should really try something like that.
Stuart.
Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)
...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
I mean, youre my best friend.
Elaine! What is going on?
(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
NEXT!
D-Deon Rifkin?
Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
Do you really want me to go?
Tonight?
Well, lets just take a look here.
M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already!
Elaine, I was adopted.
Yeah.
Didnt mean what?
Alex.
What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
How can you say that?
All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.
What?
Howard Metro.
Hey.
Bad bad association?
O.K. you got your list?
Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan...
Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?
Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)
He asked me if I still saw you. I said, Sure, I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)
Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday.
NO, NO. COME ON!
Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?
That's my mother.
Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.
(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.
I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic.
No, there's no resemblance.
Stu--Stuart's no good?
Do you think I need a haircut?
I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
Right.
After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.
Grrrr!
