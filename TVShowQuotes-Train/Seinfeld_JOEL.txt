So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?
Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.

NEXT!
O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.

Elaine, I was adopted.

Tonight?

Right.
Do you really want me to go?
Do you think I need a haircut?
So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics.
Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan...
(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
Massaging your neck.
Bad bad association?
...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.
All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.
(crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
Is there a real bird in the back?
Well, lets just take a look here.

I mean, youre my best friend.
Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?

(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
Yeah.
Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)
(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.
Not working? What are you talking about?
What?
What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday.

Howard Metro.
Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
Stuart.
M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
Elaine! What is going on?
I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, Im your biggest fan!
How can you say that?
O.K. you got your list?
Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.
That's my mother.
