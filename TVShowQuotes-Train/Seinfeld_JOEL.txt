Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.
(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
(crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan...
Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
NEXT!
Right.
NO, NO. COME ON!
I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
Grrrr!
O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.
Bad bad association?
Alex.
Massaging your neck.
He asked me if I still saw you. I said, Sure, I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)
Is there a real bird in the back?
Stu--Stuart's no good?
Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.
Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?
(from the hallway) Kramer.
...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
Sure?
Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)
Tonight?
Do you think I need a haircut?
No, there's no resemblance.
All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.
So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?
Yeah.
After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.
Didnt mean what?
I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic.
You know, I should really try something like that.
What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!
Not working? What are you talking about?
Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
Stuart.
Howard Metro.
Elaine! What is going on?
(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already!
Deon Benes?
I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, Im your biggest fan!
How can you say that?
(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.
Do you really want me to go?
Elaine, I was adopted.
O.K. you got your list?
O.K.
So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
D-Deon Rifkin?
Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)
M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday.
Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?
What?
