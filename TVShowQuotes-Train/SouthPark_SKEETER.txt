Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. 
No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! 
They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.
Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 
We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.
Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! 
Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.
Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. 
That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!
Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! 
Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
'Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.
Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.
Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.
You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. 
Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!
Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!
Whoa! Lookie her!  Hey! Beautiful woman!  We don't take kindly to your types around here!
'Did you forget them towers in New York?'Did you forget how it made you feel'To see them towers come down?'Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?
Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!
If they get that petition passed, it's all over.
Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two "nigger" guys!
We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.  And the anti-war people. 
Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"!
We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!
Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.
Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.
You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!
See? I told you they had your son.
They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!
Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
