Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!
No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! 
Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! 
That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!
That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.
There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. 
Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"!
If they get that petition passed, it's all over.
Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. 
That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
'Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.
What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
Whoa! Lookie her!  Hey! Beautiful woman!  We don't take kindly to your types around here!
No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.
Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! 
They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!
See? I told you they had your son.
Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 
That did not seriously come out of your ass.
There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. 
They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.
Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.
You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. 
It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.
Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.
They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? 
Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! 
Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. 
We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.  And the anti-war people. 
Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two "nigger" guys!
It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!
Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!
