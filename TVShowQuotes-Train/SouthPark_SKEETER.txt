They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.

If they get that petition passed, it's all over.

Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! 

The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!

Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!

He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.

Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!

Let's get him! 

Damn "nigger" guys!  We'll be back! 

Yeah!

We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.  And the anti-war people. 

Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!

Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.

Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. 

You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!

Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.

Get him! 

But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? 

Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!

We must defend our country.

They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!

We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!

Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"!

Eh- Excuse me?

Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.

Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 

That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!

See? I told you they had your son.

Aha-  ...Hey. We're all laughing. 

Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.

Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!

Huh?

I believe freedom isn't free.

Where you goin' "nigger" guy?

Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!

They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.

There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. 

Yeah. Free Hat.

I'm a little for supportin' our troops.

Whoa! Lookie her!  Hey! Beautiful woman!  We don't take kindly to your types around here!

Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! 

Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.

I'll be the muscle of America

There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. 

Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.

Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.

Hey I'm a little bit country

We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.

Eeeek!

It's working!

We don't take kindly to panda bears!

Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!

No?

Who?

Woo!

You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. 

No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!

Let's get him.

It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.

'Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.

It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!

Sure. Give that man a baby!

Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!

I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. 

Oh boy, do I feel stupid.

That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!

What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!

I think we scared 'im.

That did not seriously come out of your ass.

Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!

We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.

Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two "nigger" guys!

'Did you forget them towers in New York?'Did you forget how it made you feel'To see them towers come down?'Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?
