Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...
That's a relief...
What friend?
No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)
Sure.
Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)
Hello.
...When I travel.
You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
Sign here.
It's still there...
I'm the exterminator.
Do I know you?
Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.
I think about you all the time.
Sure.
I missed you.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
Yeah, sure.
Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?
Today?
Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
I'm a great skier.
The couch!
It's just too bad.
It still smells.
Throw it!
Hi.
Hi.
Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
