I'm the exterminator.
The couch!
I think about you all the time.
Sure.
Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...
Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?
Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
Do you think about me?
I missed you.
Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
The valet had such bad B.O.?
Sure.
I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
Sign here.
Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.
You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm a great skier.
Throw it!
Yeah, sure.
What friend?
I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)
Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)
Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
It still smells.
Do I know you?
...When I travel.
It's just too bad.
It's still there...
Today?
