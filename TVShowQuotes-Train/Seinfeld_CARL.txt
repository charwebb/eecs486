Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...
I think about you all the time.
Hi.
Sure.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
It still smells.
Do I know you?
Do you think about me?
Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?
No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)
It's still there...
Sign here.
I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
That's a relief...
The valet had such bad B.O.?
Today?
I'm a great skier.
Hello.
The couch!
Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.
Throw it!
Hi.
Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
...When I travel.
I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
What friend?
I'm the exterminator.
It's just too bad.
Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)
You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
Yeah, sure.
