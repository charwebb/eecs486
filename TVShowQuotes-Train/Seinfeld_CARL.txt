Hello.
I'm the exterminator.
The valet had such bad B.O.?
Sign here.
I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?
Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
It still smells.
Today?
Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
Throw it!
Do I know you?
Yeah, sure.
No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)
I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
Hi.
You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
The couch!
Do you think about me?
I'm a great skier.
Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
Hi.
Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.
What friend?
...When I travel.
I missed you.
Sure.
I think about you all the time.
It's still there...
I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)
It's just too bad.
