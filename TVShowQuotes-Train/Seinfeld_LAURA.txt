(laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine?
Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but Id just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.
(referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?
No, Id love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that Im right open.
You, you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. And Im on this emotional roller coaster.
Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible  and if its not, fine  for me to stay here tomorrow night too?
Youd really like him, you know, I cant wait to get on that boat.
You know, I cant believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of we. Ugh, its a very stressful situation.
