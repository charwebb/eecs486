When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."
Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.
Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-
I just... I just can't seem to stop.
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...
No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 
A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS

This is a really good idea...
So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 
But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?
Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.
Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
Get out of my face! Get out of here! 
That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 
All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.
Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 
All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!
Heh, some people are so picky about their towels
That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 
Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.
No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 
Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?
Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 
Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?
Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 
How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?
You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 
My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 
Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
