When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."

What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.

Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 

Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 

That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.

So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 

I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 

Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.

Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .

Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.

No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?

I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 

My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 

You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 

I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.

Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.

That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 

Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.

No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.

Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!

Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.

Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself.

This is a really good idea...

...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?

Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...

I just... I just can't seem to stop.

Get out of my face! Get out of here! 

Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 

I guess I could edit those chapters down some.

Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.

Heh, some people are so picky about their towels

Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.

Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?

You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!

Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?

Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.

When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.

All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.

If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.

You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.

All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!

I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 

Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 

Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.

Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 

When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."

But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.

Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-

How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?
