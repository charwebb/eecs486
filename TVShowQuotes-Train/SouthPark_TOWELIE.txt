Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.
Get out of my face! Get out of here! 
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 
Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...
That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 
How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 
Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 
You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 
When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."
Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
I just... I just can't seem to stop.
A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS

This is a really good idea...
You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 
What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?
Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.
My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 
You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 
No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 
All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!
All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 
Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?
Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 
That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 
When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 
When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.
Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .
Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
