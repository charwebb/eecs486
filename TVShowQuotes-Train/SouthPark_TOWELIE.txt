Well Larry, I'm a little high.

For what?

Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!

That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 

Wha' what's goin' on?

All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.

No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?

Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.

Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.

Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.

What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.

Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.

Alright, see ya. 

Yeah. Yeah, that's it!

Yep! And it's all true.

How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?

When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."

All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!

Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 

All right. All right, I'll go.

Huh?

Are we gonna get high?

Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.

Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.

Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?

It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.

Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.

Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.

Do you wanna get high?

Do you wanna get high?

Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-

Is!

Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.

My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 

Yeah!

I think so.

Hey yeah.

So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 

I just... I just can't seem to stop.

Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.

You're a towel!

You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!

Yeah.

No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.

Okay wait...  No, no wait. 

I know.

You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 

Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!

Yeah, I think so.  Oh man.

You asshole.

Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 

Hoooo!

Get out of my face! Get out of here! 

Alright!  Do you wanna get high?

Okay... You sure?

Hey it's been a long time!

Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.

Hey, you own me money, asshole!

Where are we goin'?

All right!

McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.

What?

Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 

I I don't, I don't get this.

Why?

Don't preach to me, fatso!

Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.

Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!

You're stupid!

Yeah, hi.

Heh, some people are so picky about their towels

But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.

I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! 

Could we just end this please?

Don't forget to bring a towel.

Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?

Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.

I guess I could edit those chapters down some.

You mean, you don't want Towelie around?

I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 

What are these things?

Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.

Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.

You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.

I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 

Don't forget to bring a towel.

Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .

Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.

Oh yeah, just a sec. 

Don't forget to bring a towel. 

If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.

M-maybe it's down that dirt road.

That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.

Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...

Hey wait a minute.  Pssst! 

I'm sorry. I'm high.

Well, I'm gonna get a little high. 

I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.

No way! They're my friends!

When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."

Well, maybe just a little high. 

All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 

Well you're a beaner towel.

Aw Jesus, man.

Let's see.  No. 

Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 

I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.

Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 

All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 

That's my last joint, asshole!

This is a really good idea...

Oh my God! No-o-o-o!

Where's what?

What is everybody doing here?

Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.

I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 

When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.

Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it!
