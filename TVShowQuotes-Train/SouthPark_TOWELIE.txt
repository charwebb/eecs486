All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 

Hey everybody, how's it goin'?

Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .

You're a towel!

I guess I could edit those chapters down some.

A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS

This is a really good idea...

How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?

Get away from me, you evil towel!

Wha' what's goin' on?

You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.

All right!

Do you wanna get high?

Alright!  Do you wanna get high?

Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!

I'm sorry. I'm high.

Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 

I I don't, I don't get this.

Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!

Huh? Why not?

But I thought you said-

For what?

Let's see.  No. 

You're stupid!

What is everybody doing here?

All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.

Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.

Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.

All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 

Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...

Yeah. Yeah, that's it!

Don't forget to bring a towel. 

No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.

Are we gonna get high?

Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.

Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.

Get out of my face! Get out of here! 

Don't preach to me, fatso!

No way! They're my friends!

It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.

Oh yeah, just a sec. 

McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.

Awww.

Yeah, hi.

Hey yeah.

You mean, you don't want Towelie around?

Well calm down.

Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!

Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!

What?

Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.

You're a towel!

Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 

That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 

Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?

I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 

Don't forget to bring a towel.

Could we just end this please?

Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.

When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."

Alright, see ya. 

You're a towel.

I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.

I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! 

When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."

I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.

Yeah.

M-maybe it's down that dirt road.

Don't forget to bring a towel. 

Don't forget to bring a towel.

I know.

Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.

Hoooo!

Yeah, I think so.  Oh man.

Do you wanna get high?

Heh, some people are so picky about their towels

Well, I'm gonna get a little high. 

Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.

Aw Jesus, man.

Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.

Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.

I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 

If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.

Okay... You sure?

That's my last joint, asshole!

I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.

What are these things?

All right. All right, I'll go.

Hey, you own me money, asshole!

Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 

What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.

You asshole.

Where are we goin'?

Oh my God! No-o-o-o!

Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 

Yep! And it's all true.

Well Larry, I'm a little high.

But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.

No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?

I think so.

You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 

I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 

Why?

When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.

Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.

Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.

Well, maybe just a little high. 

...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?

Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!

Don't forget to bring a towel.
