All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 
Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.
...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 
Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 
When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.
You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.
Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 
What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 
Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 
How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.

This is a really good idea...
Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
I just... I just can't seem to stop.
No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .
Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 
Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?
Get out of my face! Get out of here! 
Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-
Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.
That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 
Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 
Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
Heh, some people are so picky about their towels
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?
No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp.
