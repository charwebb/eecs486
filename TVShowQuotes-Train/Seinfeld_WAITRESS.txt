So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.
Oh, yeah I was sorry to hear she left.
I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.
Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV?
You are really startin' to get under my skin.
Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)
(to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.
Garry Seinfield! I saw you on the Tonight Show.
You don't want bacon Ill surprise you. (she turns and walks away)
Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special.
(to George) Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. It's not even on the menu.
Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.
O.K. Cowboys, (taps pencil on her pad) What'll you have?
You wouldn't want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours.
(at the next table) Here's your knife and fork.
George, don't make me get tough with you.
He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)
