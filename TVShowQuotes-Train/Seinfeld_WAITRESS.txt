Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)
So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.
He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)
(at the next table) Here's your knife and fork.
Garry Seinfield! I saw you on the Tonight Show.
Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.
O.K. Cowboys, (taps pencil on her pad) What'll you have?
You wouldn't want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours.
(to George) Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. It's not even on the menu.
(leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
(to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.
Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV?
Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special.
You don't want bacon Ill surprise you. (she turns and walks away)
Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.
You are really startin' to get under my skin.
George, don't make me get tough with you.
