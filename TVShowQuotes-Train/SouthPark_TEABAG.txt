Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed...  for a rabbit.
Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. 
Boys, get out of here!  Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. 
Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter.
AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! 
Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others.
Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. 
Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
Look more closelier.  With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it.  That... is Saint Peter.  The original Pope of Christianity.
I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. 
Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  Alright, we're in biz.  It's all there, man.
