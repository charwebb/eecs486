I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
[quietly] Okay.
Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...
Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...
Can I open it?
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
Darryl, you shouldn't have.
Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
[leaving] That's really rude.
What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
I don't think it goes that way.
Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
[reading card] ���I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.��� Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
They're so elegant.
How'd you know?
Pam. Pam?
Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
Si, yo muy bueno worker.
Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
No you're not.
[on the phone] Y'ello.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
Yes, I'm really good at English.
Yeah.
Got it. [taking a group photo outside]
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
Oh Darryl, hey.
Yeah.
Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
Dwight called my house, but he didn���t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can���t stay out of her stuff.
Oh, hey Pam.
So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'
He says, 'No.'
Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
What?
How long you, does it take usually? Cause...
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
[picks up blowtorch]
The building's underground?
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
You had me at ���clookies.��� I can't wait to find out what they are.
No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]
