[reading card] ���I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.��� Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
Dwight called my house, but he didn���t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can���t stay out of her stuff.
Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...
Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
How long you, does it take usually? Cause...
I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
[riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
You had me at ���clookies.��� I can't wait to find out what they are.
Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...
Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'
Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
