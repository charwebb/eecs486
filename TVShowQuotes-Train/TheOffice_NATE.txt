Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
They're so elegant.
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
[picks up blowtorch]
Yeah.
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
Oh Darryl, hey.
Darryl, you shouldn't have.
Pam. Pam?
How long you, does it take usually? Cause...
[quietly] Okay.
Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
Can I open it?
I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
How'd you know?
The building's underground?
Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...
What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
[leaving] That's really rude.
Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
Got it. [taking a group photo outside]
[on the phone] Y'ello.
Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
Yeah.
No you're not.
Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
Yes, I'm really good at English.
Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
I don't think it goes that way.
No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]
Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...
I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
Oh, hey Pam.
You had me at ���clookies.��� I can't wait to find out what they are.
I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
Si, yo muy bueno worker.
When you do your makeup,
[reading card] ���I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.��� Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
What?
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
