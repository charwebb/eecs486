Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
How long you, does it take usually? Cause...
I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
They're so elegant.
You had me at ���clookies.��� I can't wait to find out what they are.
Got it. [taking a group photo outside]
Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...
Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...
No you're not.
Pam. Pam?
I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
The building's underground?
What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
How'd you know?
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
Dwight called my house, but he didn���t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can���t stay out of her stuff.
Oh Darryl, hey.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...
[quietly] Okay.
What?
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
Yes, I'm really good at English.
No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]
I don't think it goes that way.
[reading card] ���I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.��� Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
[leaving] That's really rude.
[on the phone] Y'ello.
Yeah.
So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
Oh, hey Pam.
He says, 'No.'
Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'
Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
When you do your makeup,
Darryl, you shouldn't have.
[riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
[picks up blowtorch]
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...
Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
