I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...
Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...
So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
You had me at ���clookies.��� I can't wait to find out what they are.
[reading card] ���I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.��� Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...
Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
Dwight called my house, but he didn���t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can���t stay out of her stuff.
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...
[riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]
Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
