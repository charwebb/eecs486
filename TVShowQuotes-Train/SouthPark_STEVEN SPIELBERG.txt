Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history.  Do as you will. 
And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.
Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!
Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone.  This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!
You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.
Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.
Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back!  Okay kid, you win.  Blow it up.  Zuroch!  Zuroch!  Blow it back to God.  All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. 
Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?
I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
