So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
Sir! We've got a code 6!  All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. 
Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor! 
Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.
Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. 
Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. 
So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.
None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. 
Well well well, if it isn't the supercops. 
We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown.
Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. 
Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. 
Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
And so, did you find the missing space cash?
He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out.
