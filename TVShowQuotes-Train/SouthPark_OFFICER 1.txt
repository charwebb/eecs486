You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
Sir! We've got a code 6!  All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown.
Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor! 
It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.
Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. 
We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!
You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. 
Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. 
Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. 
Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. 
If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.
Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. 
None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
And so, did you find the missing space cash?
Well well well, if it isn't the supercops.
