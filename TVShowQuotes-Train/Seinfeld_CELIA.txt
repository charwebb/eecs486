You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.
Jerry! (she slides away from him)  Those hands! They never stop!
Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out.
I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.
So, are you the head of the foundation?
What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
Ohhh Jerry. (takes them from Jerry and puts them back with the other toys) They're priceless. They've never been played with.
No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.
What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!
Yeah. Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.
