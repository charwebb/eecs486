And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?
Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.
I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.
They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?
I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.
That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.
Not this one. It's called the "Lumbar Yard".
I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
