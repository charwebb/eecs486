I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.
Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.
Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
Not this one. It's called the "Lumbar Yard".
That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?
I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.
I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.
