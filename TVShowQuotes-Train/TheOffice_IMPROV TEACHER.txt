Ok, what about the scene they set up?
Just, I want you to get rid of all your guns and give them to me.  Great.
Ok, let's get right into it.  I need two people for the first scene.
All your characters order people around though, and-
You can't just shoot everyone in the scene.
Ok, let's call it a day.  Nice job, Bill.
Ok, Michael.  And... anybody?  How about Mary-Beth?  Come on. Ok, so you start us off Mary-Beth.
No. No. Michael, I want you to give me all the guns you have.
We don't need a suggestion for this one; it's gonna come from them. [to other students] It's a game called 'Yes, and?' and uh, you will say the first sentence.  And uh, you're telling a story-
You wanna go over the rules one more time?
Ok, you guys wanna start? [to Michael]  Don't throw out any-
Ok, for the next exercise, let's everyone pair up.[everyone picks a partner] And everyone got somebody?  Ok, good. [Michael is partner-less] Uh, ok, uh, why don't you go out in the hallway and go through all the rules in your head.  Ok, you take a break and sort of run through the rules in your head.  Ok, stay there.
