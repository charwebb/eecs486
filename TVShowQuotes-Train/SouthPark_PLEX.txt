What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa?  Foofa?
Aaaall right! Who out in the audience has a cool cool trick to show us?  What's your name, little boy?
Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! 
And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
Oh God. What has this little boy done??
Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!
Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! 
Oh, I see. You're actually-  Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no!  What are you doing to Foofa?! No!
