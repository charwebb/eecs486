Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! 
Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!
Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?
Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
Oh, I see. You're actually-  Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no!  What are you doing to Foofa?! No!
And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! 
Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa?  Foofa?
Oh God. What has this little boy done??
