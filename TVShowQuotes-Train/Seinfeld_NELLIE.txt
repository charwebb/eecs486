No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
Have you seen Darryl?
Well, it doesn't make you stupid.
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Oh, is it?
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
I���m very self-conscious about my feet.
No.
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
Jim, could you give us a hand?
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding.
That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
$30, yes!
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
[laughs mischievously] Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!
Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Oh.
Dwight, are you all right?
Mm-hm.
Oh, get out, skeleton man!
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Then you accept it?
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
No, I���m sorry but that is true.
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
Allow me to solve your problem, then.
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
Well, this is getting us nowhere.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Mmm. [exits, Erin smiles deviously]
Dwight told me about it earlier.
Angela advances.
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
Dwight. ��You���re the vice president.
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
Jim, time for your review.
Robert.
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Oh, you signed it?
Um.
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
No.
And a wave crashing��� a wave crashing.
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Nope.
Let's get Darryl Val.
Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
Fine.
Oh, I don't care.
What did I just say? What did I just say?
Oh, I don���t know. Okay.
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Oh God.
I will see you in seven-
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
[As trash is thrown at her] Fluke.
Yes?
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
Are you insulting my guests?
Darryl, looking good!
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Get her out.
Wow.
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
..writing..
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Oh of course, you were adopted.
Yes.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
He is so good, though.
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
Oh man.
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
The mind is part of the body.
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
I didn���t really think about it like that.
Oh.
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
Five... four...
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
Shh.
No...more...talking.
Oh yes.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
Were they angry?
You don't need to-
Oh, that is lovely.
Why thank you.
Oh, come on!
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
[hears knocks on door.] Come in!
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking���a mural.
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
Alright then.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
Darryl is ���dating��� Dunder Mifflin.
[sighs]. How can you be sure?
Let me just get the projector working.
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
Mm-hmm.
What are the three pillars of retail?
Oh no.
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
aagh!
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
How are you feeling?
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
Ah, what is your topic?
So far, so good.
In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
Thank you. I���m��� so stupid.
I will.
Three... two... one...
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
He doesn't even care.
Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
mm-hmm���
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy���s head].
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
You have to choose one now.
Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
Or what's her name.
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
Stop saying no.
Like I'm on the beach.
Yes. [Kisses Toby]
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
Mm-hmm.
Oh, gosh.
Do you want to go again?
Hmm, no.
He's doing it.
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
Like you.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Um, is this a good time?
Mmm.
Well, I don't want any soup.
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
I���m sexy Toby.
What?
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
But he���s flirting with Jim���s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
Yeah
Brilliant.
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
Well, they deserve each other, then.
Three...
Oh come on, Andy!
Oh, why, is there something?
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
Oh... Stanley?
[everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.
It's not..it's not
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Whoo!
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Too weird.
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
No, no, no, not numbers, no.
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
Not necessarily
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Something wrong Dwight?
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
[laughs] Well, I have considered kidnapping one.
Ah ha!
Marriage counseling?
No.
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
Absolutely not. Seven percent.
How you doing?
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Andy.
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Oh! Which public figure?
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
Andy.
Yes, Robert!
Mm.
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect.
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
That���s....
Dwight, you will be participating.
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
No.
You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'
[nail stylist 2 giggles] What?
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
Whhooooo!
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
Kevin, did you make that yourself?
���What we have���?
The pill is mine.
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
Oooohh... you salty dog.
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Is it gonna be long?
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
Creed, you are a thousand years old.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
Thank you, Andy.
I don't need anyone to-
Yes?
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you���ll need a prescription.
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
Impressive.
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
That is absolutely revolting!
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
Hm?
Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby's lips]
Okay.
Oh, please don't use the hourglass.
No.
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Let's go again. Five... four...
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
It's not..it's-
Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
Oh, good lord.
���In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There���s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.���
Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
What do you mean?
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
You're the stupid one.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.
Why are you sitting down like that?
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
Ew. That���s not good.
Oh.
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
Good night Andy.
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
Yeah.
Quite enormous.
That is for sure.
Brilliant!
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Wonderful, thanks.
Whoo!
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
Whoo!
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Great, thank you.
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
I am in too, Pam.
Hey Toby.
[squealing]
No.
Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
No.
That one looks empty.
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
What should we say about Jim?
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
How did that look?
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
[speechless.] I...
What?
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
Loyalty is exactly right.
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
Yes!
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
I will be right back.
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Andy?
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
And Filipino. But we���ll break that to her later.
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
Oh, god, Pam. Don���t get me started.
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
[chuckles] What, then?
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
You.
That was exhausting.
Performance reviews.
Angela, two hundred dollars!
No. And I thought I unfriended you.
Oh!
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
No, you don't understand-
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
Absolutely not!
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Stupid like you.
Entrapment if I'm..
Uh��� that is excellent.
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Oh!
Well, Angela is the winner.
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
I'm Tinkerbell.
Okay, just calm down.
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
