I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
A year? You were together for a year?
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
So far no one will admit to it.
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
I want to continue working on our friendship.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
None of this makes any sense to me!
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Come on. I was in line before you.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
You really think we can get that back?
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
Wait, why do you have to record it?
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
There���s a call for you on line one.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
You have a cool place to come hang.
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
