I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Yes.
How are you? How's your family doing?
[checking Pam's head] Yikers, lice.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
I'm in the bathroom.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
When I win...
Wah!! Aggenda!!
Dothraas! chek! [giggles]
I just said there isn't love.
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
Thank you.
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Okay, okay.
Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
It was Andy, wasn't it?
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
All right.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
[laughs exaggeratedly]
What's this game?
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
No. [laughs] Did you?
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
I hate your roof!
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Yeah, ok, good.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
That's rule #1.
He says no.
Andy!
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
Here you go.
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
From my secret admirer. That's you!
And did you get the tickets?
Who did?
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Fun!
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Does he have a flipper?
Every martini has an olive.
I don't want anyone to die.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Hey guys.
Yeah.
Hey!
Okay, champagne.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
Ahh! [bird steals her hat]
Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
Andy, you don���t want that.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Uh!
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
When you lost the manager job-
Oh.
What's America gonna do?
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
I'm in my jammy-jams!
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
Hi.
Alright.
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Oh it's... [points to conference room]
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
She had so much -
Great.
Your two o'clock. [Danny enters]
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
I was ahead of you!
Okay, I kill you now.
How about you?
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Die hard. Every line. Go.
He sounds like an idiot.
What do you think?
Yeah it's a TV show...
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
Andy-
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
How long will he be gone?
Yeah I love that.
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
People say you cry all the time.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
Yeah.
Well, that's not my personality.
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
Well, how about Thursday?
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
There's nothing in it.
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]
[grunting] Hey, Andy.
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
But you can leave your arm.
Oh, guys, it���s starting! Hurry!
Oh. Gross.
Jim? Tell them what it's called.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Wow.
For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
Oh.
Yeah!
Really?
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Oh, my God.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
A thousand.
Bye.
Yeah, I���m alternating. [gestures both men]
Let's do it!
Hey, Dwight Snoot.
Hi guys!
What do you-!
Really?
Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
[quietly] What?
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Do you think they canceled the wedding?
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Oh...
I'm trying to save you from yourself!
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Oh
Okay.
Come on. I was in line before you.
Ohohohoh.
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
David Wallace is calling.
You're up.
Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
What was the case?
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
Thursday?
[nods] Extension 147.
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
I bet. You guys.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
He���s absolutely right. I���m really struggling.
Hey.
Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
Oh, yeah.
What? Why are we-
I know. You get to pick.
Thank you.
Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you.
We could be roommates.
Hi Dwight!
Well...
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
Yeah.
[knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Good...
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
I know.
Six months.
Hey, aren't you an actor?
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Thanks, Michael.
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Michael? The limo's here for you.
Oh, is he...
Andy, don���t go in there!
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Jim, are you in?
What you doing?
Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
[as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Thanks.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
I have really enjoyed our time together.
No.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
I'm ready.
Okay. We fan out...
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Good me too!
Uh...
Are you in a lot of pain?
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
Oh I know.
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Oh. Come on.
Really playing the scales, huh?
Getting things done. Awesome!
What were you thinking? [Andy freezes]
Two dates? Three dates?
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
What do you...
Dwight, are you okay!?
Thank you, goodnight.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
Did it affect you outside of the office?
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
None of this makes any sense to me!
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
No.
Can you just do it?
But... they're penises.
[Laughs and shrieks]
Oh, who else is going?
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Sure, if you are.
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
What is it?
Wait, why do you have to record it?
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
[growling] Come on!
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
Really?
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Just got some ice.
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
I don't love you anymore.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
We can do anything you want.
All that color.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
Yeah.
Okay.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
You���re not married yet?
[bumps into Meredith] Sorry.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
I do really want him.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Oh hey, didn't see you.
I don't have one.
That's so random.
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
[laughs]
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Unplanned pregnancy.
Wow.
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
That's crazy.
Yeah, he is!
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Hi.
Gabe!
Why don't you like him?
I really think you should leave.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Yeah.
That's really great, you guys.
Oscar is with the Senator too?
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
[chuckles]
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
That's yours?
Dang it! What the heck already?
Sorry.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
I haven't seen it.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
OK!
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Hi.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Oh my god!
What is the most romantic possible thing?
Okay...
Wow. He got to purple.
Hey, are you okay?
Lunch was fine.
What?
Aww, cute.
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
It's a cafe disco.
Why?
Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
How was the dentist?
Thank you! [leaves the room]
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
Hey.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Quiet.
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Oh, yeah!
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Sure.
Oops!
You mean more like dangerous curves...
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
Great.
DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
Andy!
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Pam.
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
You knew.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
They want you to pay for it.
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
Oh my God.
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Oh.
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Yes?
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
I���m so happy for you Kelly.
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Like a benign tumor.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
Chocolates.
Andy���s coming back today!
A year? You were together for a year?
You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Oh sure.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
Hey.
What do you think is on it?
I think he's around here...
Apoplexy.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
No, come on.
Oh!
Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Whew.
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
[laughing] Yeah.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
We did it. Youth task force forever.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
[looking disheveled] Hey.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Okay.
Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
Thank you.
[at vending machine] B-9.
And you have any advice or anything?
Welcome back, 'Dad!'
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
Heyyy! Study buddies!
Do I still have a job here?
Don't mind us. You keep working.
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
It stings a lot.
Yes.
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
The cow jumped over the moon.
He says salvation. No last name.
Yeah.
There's a 'Shrek' two?!
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
Okay.
Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
Whoo!
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Oh god.
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
He's around here somewhere.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Hey.
How is everything? How's your car?
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
Yeah!
I hate it! I hate your car!
..just have some messages for you.
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
He's coming.
Really? Because your mother is dead.
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
Michael?
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
You listen to me. You are
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Yes.
What else you got?
Right. I'm sorry.
Andy?
No, he's not.
I really love your outfit.
Yes.
Michael!
Super romantic.
Irene, what would you do without me?
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
Hit 'er up.
Oh, I can go.
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
That was a really rough scene.
Geez louise.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
What do you think happened?
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Fire him. No, show mercy.
Who should I say is calling?
No, all we need is mayonnaise.
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
There���s a call for you on line one.
Yeah.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Really?
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Night Michael.
Hey.
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Ow.
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
Well that's a sales desk.
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Andy?
Wow. That guy���s really into paper.
I don't know what to say.
Foth aggenda!
Yes!
Probably from seeing that turkey.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Yes?
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
[concerned] Are you having a good time?
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
[to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused...
Okay.
You have a cool place to come hang.
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
Okay.
Ah! Love to learn.
[giggles] Oh Dwight!
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
See? We can all be friends!
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
I heard it from Michael.
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Line 2.
I'm Erin Hannon.
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
You're soaking wet.
You really think we can get that back?
[everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Wow.
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Seriously?
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
Yeah.
Oh my God.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
Sorry.
[gasps] Oh. Cool.
Why was she in this building?
Oh, my God! What happened?
And, you're my friend.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
What is with these turkeys?
The Bernard family seal. Duh.
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
I was flirting with a man.
Lower.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
So, I'm Erin. Hi.
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Yes?
Andy you look awful!
You promised!
Uhhhh, they were engaged?
Did you write this?
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
Yeah.
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Important.
Next!
Your hand's cold.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Di-Did you say vampire?
These are amazing.  You took all these?
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Whoo!
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
Yes, of course.
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Dwight!
Um, stimulate the nipples.
Aw, heck ya!
Yeah.
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
[annoyed] All right.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Do you want to keep this?
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
Oh, my gosh!
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
You got really sunburned.
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Oh! Darryl's funny.
Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
Really?
They said the both of you.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
Addor!
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
[moans, pulls hair over her face]
The movies. I don't know.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Nothing. It's wide open.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
[laughing] Yeah.
Yeah.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
[in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
Yes. So do I.
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
Thanks for covering the phones.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Right, yes.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
Thank you.
[gasps]
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Get upstairs, mister!
Really. It's not a big deal.
Ashley! You made it!
Oh, Dwight.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Close.
He's my foster brother.
OK.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
So... [points out their matching heart pins]
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
How do you return coffee?
Oh! [fumbles for phone]
Do you want to keep this?
Hello.
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
No, you?
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Cool. Thanks.
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Never say that.
I didn't feel anything.
Ugh.
Hi.
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
A lot of fun.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
What, do you two know each other?
Game on.
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
OK. [takes shot, group laughs]
I want to continue working on our friendship.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Right now?
Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
I played 'ape.'
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
I can't. I-
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
And we did.
[in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
No.
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Vos!
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
I get it.
Yeah.  It���s old. [smiling]
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Exactly.
Is--do the people--
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
Who's hungry?
I didn't want to miss it.
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
Kelly! Great costume!
No.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Cause America was discovered.
Andy!
What?
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Let's go.
Mm-Mmm.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
You read the fax.
What? [confused]
He's just gonna call back.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
Oh God!
Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
Oh, no.
Maybe we should just go.
Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
Pam, what are you?
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
Oh. Hey, champions.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Do they not like me, though?
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Sure. Sure we did.
Haho!
Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
[gets up] Oh.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Want some company?
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
What does that one do?
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
So it's faster.
[sitting on bench outside groaning]
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
Andy's just coming as my date.
That feels so good!
Gabe?
Thanks.  It���s on medium.
[sad] Okay, sorry.
Goodbye for a very very long time.
And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
[cheerfully] Okay.
Oh.
Pam, phone call.
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
Yes?
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
This fax came for you. [Coughs]
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
[awkwardly] I have to go Phyllis.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Of course.
We want to dance with you.
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
I...
Sorry.
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
No, you go -- okay.
Gabe, I don't-
It was a little much Andy.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Building loyalty.
Oh!
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Interesting.
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Yeah.
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
Yeah Jim! [Group claps]
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
Seriously?
So far no one will admit to it.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
I've heard that's amazing when it works.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
It's pronounced wacko.
Come on, don't you want to play?
Well... [Jo closes door on her]
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Hey, you were in there forever.
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Oh.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Well no, they're from clients.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
I'm sorry.
I haven't seen it.
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
Um,. it���s empty.
I just... there's always one around.
Oh. That must be nice.
Andy.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
[screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight]
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
Yeah.
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
Movie is starting.
[sings] Going to Pennsylvania.
I care if
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
I would have chosen the 1490's.
Andy...
Oh, okay.
Wow!
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
I can't trust Andy anymore.
She always eats my lunch.
Clark's a dead man.
Yes.
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Can I help you?
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Colder.
Absolutely.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Hey... don't listen.
Are you okay?
Sure.
You in the boss's chair!
[shocked] Oh!
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
Okay, let's hear it.
You should move down here with me.
Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
We've already rescheduled seven times.
Okay.
Wait which one?
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
You have a very important call.
That's a really tight argument.
Drive carefully!
Fine.
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
She wandered off like an idiot.
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
[giggles] Stop.
$300.00
What are you thinking?
How���s Florida?
I'm hungry.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Absolutely.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Wow!
He said limousine, so...
Robert California. Let���s have a conversation.
Because of your slaves.
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
Dwight's car is gone.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Darryl?! Darryl!
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
Yeah.
No, he's not making this up.
I really think you're better off.
Why would I keep you from coming?
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Gabe!
Are you sure? It���s really, really important.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Tuh.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Good.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
How do you know where I live?
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
Service.
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
[to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Hey guys, any spots left?
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
Yay!
You���re not going to get it though?
Wow.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
How long were you guys together?
You're going to be alright
Psst! Psst!
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
This is a tanned spot.
Why?
Oh yeah. What else you got?
Hi.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
So I'll see you guys around!
Hey.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Come on! [claps]
I would like another alcohol.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Okay!
Come on. You got this. Here.
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
I went to Portugal.
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Nice!
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
Oh, thank you.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
You can actually stop.
Bahamas, Andy.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Nip slip.'
Jim...
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
It���s just Pete in sunglasses.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
This is all I could find.
...Help me feel better...
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Why would I hide it! [giggling]
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
You mean, put me on the news?
Good morning, Meredith.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Ok, everybody ready?
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
No, I don't have any stuff.
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
I don't know, I just haven't.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Deangelo, did you order a barber?
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Thanks.
Oh, god!
Yeah...
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Whoa. the lights are still on.
Okay, good.
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Are you alright?
No!
Erin123'
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Hey.
Okay.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
[whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because..
No, no, no, he's not looking.
Yeah.
Mm!
��� a measuring cup���
Don't change the subject.
I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Witch���s brew?
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Why's it so far away?
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
Well.
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
Let's get out of here.
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Maybe in six months-
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
Well...
Well, I saw them in there.
I think we should toast...
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
[point to picture] It's Michael!
Sure.
But it's not for--
[whining] What?
Who says none of us are diarrheal?
I guess.
Hi.
I wish I had seen you do it.
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
[laughs] You love drama.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
Darryl.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
Oh.
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Phyllis!
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Oy. Andy, what���s going on?
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Michael, could I talk to you privately?
What we said to do.
Oh!
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
They're back!
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Andy go braugh to you!  Nice kilt!
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Oh.
Ok.
Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office]
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Thanks.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Oh, like a goodbye trip.
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Ha!
No. No more talking. It's movie time.
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
Hello.
A paper company.
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
I'm moving down here, you know.
Kelly has an eating disorder?
What���s wrong?
Hey.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
No.
Hey.
Well I have an idea.
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
Do you need a hand?
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Ooh, spooky.  But why?
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Yeah!
Ow!
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
There's a dog in the car.
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
I don't feel like it either!
You left us without saying goodbye.
Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
Oh. One Erin Special, please.
Hi.
We're pin twins.
Good. We don't need her.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
He just rolled out and crawled out.
Go!
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Hey Creed.
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Thanks.
For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
Guys, who's Holly?
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
And here's the fax for you.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Oh just by like friends.
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
Whoo!
Hoo-hoo!
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Well, I like to swim.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
Oh, my God. It's a song.
Is he really five pounds?
Andy.
One more?
You look like J-Lo.
I can't, 'cause there's no clue.
[shrugs] I've done it all my life.
Oh, you weren't going to do that?
Go! Okay. Yeah.
[in agreement] Hmmm!
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
It's Andy's fault.
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Gee, he was salty.
Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
I wasn't recording it.
Oh, I put those up.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
[whispers] It's the fuzz!
No, I watch the news.
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Hi, guys. How you doing?
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
Yeah!
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Oh, sorry.
[breathes heavily, groans]
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
Nice.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
I know.
Now I do got it.
Yeah! [laughs]
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Well, everyone got one.
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Oh, I like his butt.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
I'll go with you.
[checking Stanley's head] Ooh yabber, lice!
So what comes next?
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
[accent] Where are you taking me?
Flying jib.
Yes.
You���re not going to take it?
[from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley!
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Yeah!  Let���s do it!
Kelly got into the minority training program.
To be washed.
[whispers] Convenience.
I'm trying. Sorry.
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Yeah, have some more blanket.
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
Thank you Jim.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Thank you Pam.
I guess we don���t have a choice.
Oh my gosh!
Good morning.
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Qazer!
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Thanks.
I don't know.
You want to keep this?
Hello.
No, go ahead.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
Wow, it smells really good too.
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
Thank you.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Yes! [Group cheers]
But you hurt your hand.
I thought that's what you were doing.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
Hello, Peter.
And...
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Um, where's the shower?
He���s in the bathroom.
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
Hi!
Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Oh. [liquid splatters]
Do a hundred jumping jacks.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
Ooh, about what?
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
One dance, all of us together.
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
[quietly] Is this a joke?
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
[Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy!
[Dwight dunks her] Oh!
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
