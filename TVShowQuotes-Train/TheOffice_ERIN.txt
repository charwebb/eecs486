[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
I want to continue working on our friendship.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
None of this makes any sense to me!
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
Those posters used to be real French ads.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
So far no one will admit to it.
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
I wish I had seen you do it.
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
A year? You were together for a year?
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
There���s a call for you on line one.
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
Come on. I was in line before you.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
You really think we can get that back?
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
You have a cool place to come hang.
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
