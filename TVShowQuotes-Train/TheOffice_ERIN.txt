Michael, people are asking questions.
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
You���re not married yet?
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
It was a little much Andy.
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
And...
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
Irene, what would you do without me?
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
[shrugs] I've done it all my life.
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Seriously?
Andy's just coming as my date.
Die hard. Every line. Go.
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
You mean, put me on the news?
Jim? Tell them what it's called.
Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
I'm Erin Hannon.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
When you lost the manager job-
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
Yeah.
Yeah it's a TV show...
I don't know what to say.
Well, I like to swim.
Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
You want to keep this?
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Do you need a hand?
It's pronounced wacko.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Who should I say is calling?
No.
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
Hey! Gabe.
Oh my God.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Oh my god!
Oh. That must be nice.
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
To be washed.
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
I just said there isn't love.
Pam, phone call.
Great.
Haho!
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Thank you Jim.
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
[giggles] Terrific!
[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
So I'll see you guys around!
Tuh.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Erin123'
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
Great.
Ooh, about what?
[Laughs and shrieks]
So tell me about your new girlfriend.
What?
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Movie is starting.
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Do a hundred jumping jacks.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
Hello, Peter.
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
You look like J-Lo.
Um, where's the shower?
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Hey.
I know.
Is he really five pounds?
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Getting things done. Awesome!
I would like another alcohol.
Thanks.
[gasps] Oh. Cool.
Hey Creed.
Ow!
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Oh. Come on.
Thursday?
Retail consumer habits.
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
I have really enjoyed our time together.
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
What do you think is on it?
I don't know, I just haven't.
Are you alright?
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Is--do the people--
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Oh. Gross.
Night Michael.
Okay.
[in agreement] Hmmm!
I didn't feel anything.
Yeah!
Hi guys!
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Lunch was fine.
Oh. Hey, champions.
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
[laughing] Yeah.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Yes.
[laughs] You love drama.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
Sorry.
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
[point to picture] It's Michael!
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Maybe in six months-
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Lower.
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
Whoa. the lights are still on.
[awkwardly] I have to go Phyllis.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
[laughs] That's my favorite.
Oh, I put those up.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Yeah.
Can I help you?
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
I want to continue working on our friendship.
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
Yeah.
Copy that.
Yeah!
So... [points out their matching heart pins]
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Andy go braugh to you!  Nice kilt!
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
Whoo!
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
You mean more like dangerous curves...
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Because of your slaves.
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Yeah!  Let���s do it!
[moans, pulls hair over her face]
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Why?
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]
Okay. We fan out...
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Just got some ice.
I'm in my jammy-jams!
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Hi.
Wow!
David Wallace is calling.
He's coming.
He's my foster brother.
I've heard that's amazing when it works.
I guess we don���t have a choice.
It's so edgy!
Oh, okay.
Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Maybe we should just go.
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
And we did.
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
No.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
What else you got?
Hanks.
Andy...
Good. We don't need her.
I heard it from Michael.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
You got really sunburned.
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Uh...
Well...
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
Well, everyone got one.
But, there's no clue.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
Oh God!
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
You promised!
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
[Dwight dunks her] Oh!
What do you...
[knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!
Absolutely.
Really. It's not a big deal.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
He just rolled out and crawled out.
Really playing the scales, huh?
Michael? The limo's here for you.
Okay, good.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, are you okay?
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
When I win...
Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
I haven't seen it.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
It's Andy's fault.
Oh, you weren't going to do that?
From my secret admirer. That's you!
I went to Portugal.
Thank you.
Aw!
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Building loyalty.
Oh.
I don't have one.
Line 2.
Nothing. It's wide open.
Oh, sorry.
I really love your outfit.
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
Vos!
They had sex?
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
Oy. Andy, what���s going on?
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Yeah, ok, good.
A year? You were together for a year?
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
Yeah.
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
[screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight]
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
There's nothing in it.
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
No, you stop.
I would have chosen the 1490's.
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Hey.
I was flirting with a man.
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Who���s calling?
There's a 'Shrek' two?!
Yeah.
...Help me feel better...
No.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Wow.
What���s wrong?
Hey.
He said limousine, so...
Oh, I like his butt.
I hate it! I hate your car!
Oops!
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
The Bernard family seal. Duh.
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
Addor!
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
[cheerfully] Okay.
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Thank you.
What do you-!
She wandered off like an idiot.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Andy, you don���t want that.
Who says none of us are diarrheal?
Do I still have a job here?
Aw, heck ya!
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Yeah...
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon.
Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Thank you.
Important.
Hey, aren't you an actor?
Fun!
Oh.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Okay!
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
Game on.
Ow.
Do they not like me, though?
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Wait, why do you have to record it?
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
I'm trying to save you from yourself!
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Oh, my God! What happened?
But why not find out.
Guys, who's Holly?
Hi.
Ohh. [laughs]
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Di-Did you say vampire?
Nip slip.'
I wasn't recording it.
Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office]
How is everything? How's your car?
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Hi Dwight!
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
[whining] What?
Andy?
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Yeah.
[sad] Okay, sorry.
Hi.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
What was the case?
Like a benign tumor.
Thanks.  It���s on medium.
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
Really?
Close.
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
[nods] Extension 147.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Hello.
Good.
Wait. Why?
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Well no, they're from clients.
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
I know.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
Yeah.
Deangelo, did you order a barber?
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
Wah!! Aggenda!!
But you can leave your arm.
Oh.
Hey guys, any spots left?
Oh!
What? [confused]
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
You named them?
Hi.
I get it.
Really?
I���m so happy for you Kelly.
I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Robert California. Let���s have a conversation.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
So what comes next?
Hey.
No. [laughs] Did you?
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Really?
Oh, guys, it���s starting! Hurry!
I think we should toast...
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
I was ahead of you!
What?
Oh sure.
Ukulele's happy?
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
But you hurt your hand.
Let's get out of here.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Um,. it���s empty.
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
I really think you should leave.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Gabe!
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
I do really want him.
Andy���s coming back today!
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
We can do anything you want.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
Okay.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
I played 'ape.'
Uh...
Oh, my God.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Thank you! [leaves the room]
They said the both of you.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Oh!
Oh, Dwight.
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Go!
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
Andy.
Welcome back, 'Dad!'
Dwight's car is gone.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
$300.00
Sure.
Well, how about Thursday?
I hate your roof!
A paper company.
Oh, who else is going?
Sponge.
How about you?
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
A thousand.
OK. [takes shot, group laughs]
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
You're going to be alright
Pam, what are you?
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Navy blue. Little red anchors.
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Yes, of course.
Come on. You got this. Here.
What is it?
Thanks for covering the phones.
What we said to do.
I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
I've been turned into a puppet!
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
Mm-Mmm.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
Oh, my gosh!
[Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy!
Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
Two dates? Three dates?
Wow, it smells really good too.
Hey.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Everyday is fine.  Or...
Hi!
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
Hey... don't listen.
Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
Thanks.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Thanks, Michael.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Really?
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
[quietly] Is this a joke?
What do you think?
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
I'm sorry.
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
[to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused...
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
Hi, guys. How you doing?
Ahh! [bird steals her hat]
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
How do you know where I live?
Can you just do it?
Dwight, are you okay!?
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
What were you thinking? [Andy freezes]
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
You should move down here with me.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
Yeah, he is!
He didn't even say that.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
[looking disheveled] Hey.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Oh, is he...
Ok, everybody ready?
Are you in a lot of pain?
[laughs]
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Hey.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
Where did he go, Holly?
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
We could be roommates.
Justine.  She said she���s coming by later.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
I can't, 'cause there's no clue.
She always eats my lunch.
I just... there's always one around.
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
You have a very important call.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
You left us without saying goodbye.
Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
But it's not for--
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Yeah.
Mm. [Chuckles]
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
Well, that's not my personality.
[growling] Come on!
Hey!
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
They're back!
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Dang it! What the heck already?
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Bahamas, Andy.
Sure.
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
I'm in.
I really think you're better off.
Wow.
He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
Okay.
That's a really tight argument.
Oh
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
Oh...
I don't know.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
Nothing, I just-
You���re not going to get it though?
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Are you sure? It���s really, really important.
Thank you.
Come on, don't you want to play?
Whew.
Hey.
[sitting on bench outside groaning]
I wish I had seen you do it.
You tricked me!
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Hey.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Oh, assist.
Well, I saw them in there.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
How do you return coffee?
��� a measuring cup���
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
It���s just Pete in sunglasses.
Hey.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
Now I do got it.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
Andy?
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Seriously?
Goodbye for a very very long time.
Of course.
That was a really rough scene.
Did you grow up around here?
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Why?
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Andy!
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
What about Kelly?
Six months.
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Aww, cute.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
Drive carefully!
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Right. I'm sorry.
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
Fine.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
How was the dentist?
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
I'm in the bathroom.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
Yeah, have some more blanket.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Oh. One Erin Special, please.
I care if
The cow jumped over the moon.
You���re not going to take it?
Good...
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
[gasps] Hello, waffle iron.
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
Hey, Dwight Snoot.
Are you okay?
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
They want you to pay for it.
Oh my gosh!
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
Okay.
You're up.
I bet. You guys.
You really think we can get that back?
Really? Because your mother is dead.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
Oscar is with the Senator too?
Colder.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
Hmm.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
What is that supposed to mean?
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
Thank you.
Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
We've already rescheduled seven times.
No, he's not.
[to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
And, you're my friend.
Well that's a sales desk.
I guess.
How long will he be gone?
Gee, he was salty.
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
I didn't want to miss it.
Andy, don���t go in there!
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
We're pin twins.
Michael!
No.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Never say that.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
I...
We want to dance with you.
Well.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
[bumps into Meredith] Sorry.
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Phyllis!
Sorry.
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Kelly! Great costume!
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
You knew.
Service.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
What you doing?
Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
Michael?
Darryl?! Darryl!
You read the fax.
Yes?
No, he's not making this up.
What's America gonna do?
Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
No, no, no, he's not looking.
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Right now?
Ooh, spooky.  But why?
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Oh! Darryl's funny.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
Bye.
You in the boss's chair!
Yeah, I���m alternating. [gestures both men]
You have a cool place to come hang.
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
Oh, I can go.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
No, you go -- okay.
Hoo-hoo!
Here you go.
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Witch���s brew?
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
I'm moving down here, you know.
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
Hi.
Ok.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
Oh, yeah!
Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
That's really great, you guys.
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Andy-
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Do you want to keep this?
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Get out of here!
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
I don't feel like it either!
No, you?
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
[as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
I'm ready.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
No, I watch the news.
Yay!
Why was she in this building?
Dwight!
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
Oh, thanks. Come in!
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Yeah.
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
I thought that's what you were doing.
Come on. I was in line before you.
We should do something.
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Hey, you were in there forever.
No!
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
OK!
[checking Stanley's head] Ooh yabber, lice!
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
We did it. Youth task force forever.
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
What does that one do?
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
Oh my God.
[from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley!
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
That's rule #1.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Why would I hide it! [giggling]
Uhhhh, they were engaged?
We are closed! Come on.
[sings] Going to Pennsylvania.
[giggles] Stop.
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
No.
Gabe?
Oh.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
It's a cafe disco.
There���s a call for you on line one.
Why would I keep you from coming?
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Andy you look awful!
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
Thanks.
Foth aggendi!
People say you cry all the time.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Do you want to keep this?
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
[in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
What, do you two know each other?
Oh.
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
[accent] Of course, Nathaniel.
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
No.
Heyyy! Study buddies!
He's around here somewhere.
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
[laughs exaggeratedly]
Come on! [claps]
Yeah! [laughs]
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
Ugh.
That's yours?
So far no one will admit to it.
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
That feels so good!
Probably from seeing that turkey.
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
[whispers] Convenience.
Want some company?
[annoyed] All right.
What are you thinking?
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Okay.
Yes?
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
Whoo!
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
Get upstairs, mister!
Here we go.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
He only emailed me four times.
Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
Nice!
[in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
[everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Oh, god!
Whoo!
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Really?
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
Foth aggenda!
It's about you.
Absolutely.
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Yes!
[breathes heavily, groans]
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Wow!
Jim, are you in?
Oh it's... [points to conference room]
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
Andy.
He���s in the bathroom.
Geez louise.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Hit 'er up.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
How long were you guys together?
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Thank you Pam.
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
He says no.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
No.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
One dance, all of us together.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Ohohohoh.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Yeah!
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Oh hey, didn't see you.
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Wow.
Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
All right.
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
Oh.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
I couldn't do it.
That's crazy.
[accent] Where are you taking me?
You listen to me. You are
How���s Florida?
These are amazing.  You took all these?
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
..just have some messages for you.
Psst! Psst!
Yeah.
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
I don't know.
And here's the fax for you.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Qazer!
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Thank you.
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
I know. You get to pick.
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
This is a tanned spot.
Why don't you like him?
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Your two o'clock. [Danny enters]
I'll go with you.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
What is the most romantic possible thing?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
Gabe, I don't-
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Yeah.
Don't change the subject.
Sure, if you are.
Yeah!
Um, stimulate the nipples.
What is with these turkeys?
And did you get the tickets?
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Really?
Go! Okay. Yeah.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Chocolates.
Wow.
[shocked] Oh!
Sure. Sure we did.
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
[blocks Holly's path] No.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Okay, let's hear it.
Every martini has an olive.
So it's faster.
[quietly] What?
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
And you have any advice or anything?
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
A lot of fun.
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Apoplexy.
Foth aggendak!
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Okay.
Hey guys.
Dothraas! chek! [giggles]
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
Clark's a dead man.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
Ah! Angela had the baby!
Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
[at vending machine] B-9.
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
I don't want anyone to die.
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Cool. Thanks.
Ah! Love to learn.
Oh.
Jim...
Yes.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
Oh. [liquid splatters]
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
Your hand's cold.
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
Hello.
Oh! [fumbles for phone]
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
[gasps]
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
It stings a lot.
Don't mind us. You keep working.
Darryl.
Yeah.
[concerned] Are you having a good time?
Sorry.
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
No, all we need is mayonnaise.
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
Sure.
Flying jib.
See? We can all be friends!
She had so much -
Exactly.
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Okay, champagne.
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
[checking Pam's head] Yikers, lice.
Fire him. No, show mercy.
Yes.
[whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because..
Yes.
Yes?
[doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
Cause America was discovered.
You're soaking wet.
What's this game?
That's so random.
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
I don't love you anymore.
What do you think happened?
Hi.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]
Quiet.
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
There's a dog in the car.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
Thanks.
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
It's right here in PA.
Yeah.
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
Well... [Jo closes door on her]
Absolutely. Works for me.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
[grunting] Hey, Andy.
Who did?
Well...
I can't trust Andy anymore.
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
What? Why are we-
Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
Yes.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
I don't want you to shave everything.
OK.
He's just gonna call back.
Oh.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
Pam.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
I'm trying. Sorry.
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Let's go.
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Good me too!
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
[giggles] Oh Dwight!
[chuckles]
Wow. He got to purple.
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Uh!
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
No, go ahead.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Ha!
Alright.
Oh I know.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
I'm hungry.
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
Yeah.  It���s old. [smiling]
Good morning, Meredith.
He says salvation. No last name.
I can't. I-
Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?
Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
Hello.
Oh, no.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
Kelly has an eating disorder?
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
What?
Mm!
Okay, I kill you now.
Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
Yeah!
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Does he have a flipper?
Hello.
