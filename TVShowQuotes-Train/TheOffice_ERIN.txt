Hey... don't listen.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
Hey, aren't you an actor?
Yes?
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Wow, it smells really good too.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
Well, I saw them in there.
Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Dwight gives the best back massages.
[grunting] Hey, Andy.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Wow.
I have really enjoyed our time together.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
I haven't seen it.
Oh, sorry.
But why not find out.
Oy. Andy, what���s going on?
Drive carefully!
So far no one will admit to it.
Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
[as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
[annoyed] All right.
Yes?
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
To be washed.
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
Can I help you?
Want some company?
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
Qazer!
Well, I like to swim.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Really?
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Oops!
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
Why was she in this building?
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
Where did he go, Holly?
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Oh I know.
You mean more like dangerous curves...
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
What are you thinking?
Kelly got into the minority training program.
Yeah, ok, good.
You can actually stop.
Okay, good.
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
You want to keep this?
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Line 2.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
I get it.
What were you thinking? [Andy freezes]
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
Don't change the subject.
Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
Hey, you were in there forever.
Yeah.
Does he have a flipper?
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
I didn't feel anything.
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
And did you get the tickets?
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
One dance, all of us together.
Oh hey, didn't see you.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Wow.
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
Okay.
Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?
Yes?
Hey! Gabe.
Psst! Psst!
[gasps] Hello, waffle iron.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Are you in a lot of pain?
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Oh, you weren't going to do that?
Well no, they're from clients.
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Night Michael.
Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Oh my god!
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
He sounds like an idiot.
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
Oh! Darryl's funny.
DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Mm!
He only emailed me four times.
What do you...
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
I'm hungry.
What do you-!
[laughing] Yeah.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
But you can leave your arm.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Come on, don't you want to play?
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Go! Okay. Yeah.
This is a tanned spot.
Oh my God.
I'm in my jammy-jams!
Andy!
It's a cafe disco.
Quiet.
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Well, everyone got one.
Sure, if you are.
Oh.
I went to Portugal.
Really?
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
People say you cry all the time.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
They're back!
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
[accent] Where are you taking me?
We did it. Youth task force forever.
I wasn't recording it.
What? [confused]
Really playing the scales, huh?
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
[sitting on bench outside groaning]
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
Um, where's the shower?
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
Okay, I kill you now.
Ow.
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Wow.
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
It stings a lot.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
Hello.
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
[moans, pulls hair over her face]
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
You left us without saying goodbye.
Yeah.  It���s old. [smiling]
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Yeah.
Hey.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Okay.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
I didn't want to miss it.
Unplanned pregnancy.
Gabe, I don't-
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
No, no, no, he's not looking.
Thank you.
Andy's just coming as my date.
Get upstairs, mister!
Addor!
Gabe?
I'm trying to save you from yourself!
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
[Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy!
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
..just have some messages for you.
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Yeah, I���m alternating. [gestures both men]
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
He's coming.
Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
Oh, no.
Ok.
Yeah!
You read the fax.
Darryl?! Darryl!
Who says none of us are diarrheal?
That's rule #1.
Andy���s coming back today!
See? We can all be friends!
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
And here's the fax for you.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
He says no.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Bye.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
I'm moving down here, you know.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
What do you think is on it?
[to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused...
Hey.
Great.
Oh, yeah.
Hello.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
None of this makes any sense to me!
What is it?
What we said to do.
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
Whoo!
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
Here you go.
And you have any advice or anything?
So what comes next?
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
No, you stop.
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
It���s just Pete in sunglasses.
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Good.
Maybe in six months-
Oh, thanks. Come in!
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Well, that's not my personality.
[laughing] Yeah.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Who's hungry?
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Yeah!
Apoplexy.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
Really?
It's so edgy!
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
What you doing?
Yeah.
Well that's a sales desk.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
Dothraas! chek! [giggles]
Andy?
Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Oh, I like his butt.
Hey guys.
Thank you.
Hey.
Dang it! What the heck already?
No, all we need is mayonnaise.
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
What?
It's right here in PA.
Hey.
Ashley! You made it!
Di-Did you say vampire?
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Who should I say is calling?
Really?
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
[giggles] Oh Dwight!
You got really sunburned.
No.
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
So it's faster.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Robert California. Let���s have a conversation.
Andy.
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
You listen to me. You are
Wait, why do you have to record it?
Absolutely. Works for me.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
Oh.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
That's really great, you guys.
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
I don't want you to shave everything.
Well... [Jo closes door on her]
Every martini has an olive.
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
Yeah.
Oh sure.
But, there's no clue.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Ohohohoh.
Yeah.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Lower.
Yeah.
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Oh.
Oh!
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Gabe!
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
Service.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
There's a 'Shrek' two?!
Foth aggendak!
Hey.
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
[in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Sure.
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Geez louise.
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Who did?
Uh!
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
No, he's not making this up.
Chocolates.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
Good. We don't need her.
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
What's this game?
Can you just do it?
Hey.
You have a very important call.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Well...
Oh, guys, it���s starting! Hurry!
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
Good morning.
How do you know where I live?
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Wow.
Hey.
Andy go braugh to you!  Nice kilt!
What do you think happened?
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Okay!
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
Yeah.
I really think you're better off.
The Bernard family seal. Duh.
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Oh, Dwight.
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
I just... there's always one around.
Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
Absolutely.
Come on. You got this. Here.
Jim? Tell them what it's called.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
Sorry.
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
They want you to pay for it.
[everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.
All right.
[growling] Come on!
Well, how about Thursday?
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Thank you, goodnight.
Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]
Ha!
So I'll see you guys around!
Hello.
Let's go.
How about you?
Ukulele's happy?
Oh, my God! What happened?
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
[screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight]
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Yeah.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
I hate your roof!
Thank you.
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
Maybe we should just go.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
[from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley!
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
I'm Erin Hannon.
No.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
$300.00
It's pronounced wacko.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
[nods] Extension 147.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
Wow!
I don't want anyone to die.
Thanks.
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
Yeah it's a TV show...
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Thank you Jim.
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
I don't know, I just haven't.
Is--do the people--
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Um,. it���s empty.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Why?
Oh.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
Oscar is with the Senator too?
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Jim...
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Hi.
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
Hi.
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
Important.
I know.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
It's Andy's fault.
Wow. That guy���s really into paper.
[in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!
What do you think?
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Irene, what would you do without me?
I don't love you anymore.
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
I think we should toast...
Whew.
There���s a call for you on line one.
Thank you.
Oh
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
I just said there isn't love.
Yeah.
[whispers] Convenience.
Andy.
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
[checking Stanley's head] Ooh yabber, lice!
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
I can't. I-
Here we go.
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Mm-Mmm.
Thank you Pam.
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
Hey!
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
No, come on.
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Yay!
Now I do got it.
You mean, put me on the news?
Oh my God.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Do you need a hand?
Yeah!  Let���s do it!
Yeah, have some more blanket.
Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Because of your slaves.
I don't know.
[gasps] Oh. Cool.
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Just got some ice.
Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
I don't know what to say.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
What is the most romantic possible thing?
That's yours?
Getting things done. Awesome!
How is everything? How's your car?
Are you sure? It���s really, really important.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
Cool. Thanks.
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
Ah! Angela had the baby!
[Dwight dunks her] Oh!
Oh yeah. What else you got?
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Michael?
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
No, I don't have any stuff.
Lunch was fine.
Ah! Love to learn.
Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
They had sex?
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
No!
Pam, what are you?
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
Foth aggenda!
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
What else you got?
I'm not attracted to Kevin.
[giggles] Terrific!
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Come on! [claps]
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Ow!
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Yes! [Group cheers]
There's a dog in the car.
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Hi.
Andy!
Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
I would like another alcohol.
Tuh.
Hey.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Sure. Sure we did.
No.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Uh...
So, I'm Erin. Hi.
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
No.
I wish I had seen you do it.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Game on.
Do you think they canceled the wedding?
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
Deangelo, did you order a barber?
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Sure.
I can't, 'cause there's no clue.
Oh, who else is going?
I...
And...
You tricked me!
I've been turned into a puppet!
Oh, like a goodbye trip.
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
Why would I keep you from coming?
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
No.
Everyday is fine.  Or...
Oh.
I don't know.
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Yes!
Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
Dwight's car is gone.
Well I have an idea.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
When you lost the manager job-
Pam.
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
We can do anything you want.
Justine.  She said she���s coming by later.
What, do you two know each other?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Oh. One Erin Special, please.
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
All that color.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
Right now?
Die hard. Every line. Go.
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Andy, you don���t want that.
Aw, heck ya!
I thought that's what you were doing.
He's just gonna call back.
Hi!
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
Yeah!
Yeah.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
What about Kelly?
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
Is he really five pounds?
Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
Oh.
[in agreement] Hmmm!
You really think we can get that back?
[laughs] That's my favorite.
Do a hundred jumping jacks.
It was Andy, wasn't it?
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Sponge.
What was the case?
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
[awkwardly] I have to go Phyllis.
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Ok, everybody ready?
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Did you grow up around here?
What does that one do?
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
And we did.
You���re not going to take it?
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Dwight!
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
I think he's around here...
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
I was flirting with a man.
I guess.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
[sings] Going to Pennsylvania.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
I was ahead of you!
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Interesting.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
Hoo-hoo!
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
You���re not going to get it though?
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Okay. We fan out...
No.
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, I put those up.
You in the boss's chair!
You look like J-Lo.
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
The movies. I don't know.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Oh...
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Fine.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
One more?
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
I know.
He didn't even say that.
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Are you okay?
Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
Guys, who's Holly?
Hey Creed.
Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
I can't trust Andy anymore.
Vos!
Hi guys!
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
Come on. I was in line before you.
Yeah I love that.
Okay.
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Fun!
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
Hey.
Sorry.
We've already rescheduled seven times.
Andy...
[breathes heavily, groans]
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
[whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because..
Bahamas, Andy.
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
A thousand.
Seriously?
No, you?
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Your two o'clock. [Danny enters]
Ahh! [bird steals her hat]
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Oh.
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
[shocked] Oh!
Ok.
No, you go -- okay.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Okay...
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
[whispers] It's the fuzz!
[point to picture] It's Michael!
I'm trying. Sorry.
He said limousine, so...
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Andy?
I'm in the bathroom.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
We have our decision.
This fax came for you. [Coughs]
Just the two of us.
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Don't mind us. You keep working.
Great.
��� a measuring cup���
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
Thanks.
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
Let's do it!
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Ugh.
Why's it so far away?
[quietly] What?
[cheerfully] Okay.
Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
Whoo!
Yes.
Yeah.
Well.
That's so random.
Oh, assist.
Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
He���s in the bathroom.
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
What's America gonna do?
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Do I still have a job here?
No. No more talking. It's movie time.
Oh, my God. It's a song.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
David Wallace is calling.
Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Heyyy! Study buddies!
Um, stimulate the nipples.
The cow jumped over the moon.
Oh! [fumbles for phone]
Yeah Jim! [Group claps]
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
Thanks.
Good morning, Meredith.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Oh, my gosh!
But it's not for--
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
I played 'ape.'
How was the dentist?
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
I care if
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
Foth aggendi!
Andy.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Of course.
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
[checking Pam's head] Yikers, lice.
[laughs exaggeratedly]
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
Oh, I can go.
Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
Thursday?
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Yeah!
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Well...
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
We should do something.
[giggles] Stop.
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Okay.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Close.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
From my secret admirer. That's you!
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Yeah.
Flying jib.
Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
I heard it from Michael.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Alright.
Hey, are you okay?
Okay, okay.
[doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Wait. Why?
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
Thanks.
Do you want to keep this?
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you.
Dwight, are you okay!?
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Thanks.
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
Copy that.
Nice!
Two dates? Three dates?
Next!
Retail consumer habits.
Hanks.
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
Building loyalty.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Good...
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Hi.
What���s wrong?
[to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
That was a really rough scene.
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Do you want to keep this?
Pam, phone call.
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Okay.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
You knew.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Welcome back, 'Dad!'
Like a benign tumor.
Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
I haven't seen it.
Whoo!
Yes, of course.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
Yeah.
Oh. Gross.
Goodbye for a very very long time.
[sad] Okay, sorry.
Okay.
He's around here somewhere.
[concerned] Are you having a good time?
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
Wow!
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
That's a really tight argument.
How long will he be gone?
Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
Yes.
Oh just by like friends.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
You���re not married yet?
[laughs] You love drama.
Michael? The limo's here for you.
Thanks for covering the phones.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
You should move down here with me.
Aww, cute.
It was a little much Andy.
Hey.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
Really?
You're going to be alright
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
No, go ahead.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
No, he's not.
Hit 'er up.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
She always eats my lunch.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Pam gave it to me!
Oh.
Ohh. [laughs]
I don't feel like it either!
Six months.
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
Aw!
Hey.
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
[laughs]
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
Oh, uhm, like three months.
I'm ready.
Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?
Thanks.  It���s on medium.
He says salvation. No last name.
Hello, Peter.
I'll go with you.
Oh, is he...
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Yes.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
Ooh, spooky.  But why?
Oh, my God.
Oh god.
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
What?
Oh. Come on.
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
No, I watch the news.
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Nip slip.'
Andy you look awful!
Okay, champagne.
Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office]
Ooh, about what?
Right. I'm sorry.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Oh. That must be nice.
I couldn't do it.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Oh my gosh!
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Really?
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
No. [laughs] Did you?
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
Why don't you like him?
Hey guys, any spots left?
Probably from seeing that turkey.
So... [points out their matching heart pins]
We could be roommates.
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Mm. [Chuckles]
Absolutely.
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Oh, god!
[chuckles]
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
...Help me feel better...
How long were you guys together?
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
How do you return coffee?
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
Yeah.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
Oh!
Andy!
That feels so good!
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
Erin123'
Hi.
Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
Michael, people are asking questions.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
Thank you! [leaves the room]
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
Kelly! Great costume!
Right, yes.
Okay.
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
These are amazing.  You took all these?
Oh, yeah!
Thank you.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Gabe!
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
[bumps into Meredith] Sorry.
There's nothing in it.
Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
No.
Oh God!
Hi.
I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
Kelly has an eating disorder?
Yes. So do I.
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Nothing. It's wide open.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Wow. He got to purple.
[accent] Of course, Nathaniel.
But... they're penises.
He just rolled out and crawled out.
Cause America was discovered.
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
I don't have one.
When I win...
He���s absolutely right. I���m really struggling.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
I want to continue working on our friendship.
I really think you should leave.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Uh...
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
Andy-
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Hello.
This is all I could find.
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
What?
Oh, okay.
Mm-hmm.
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Andy, don���t go in there!
Witch���s brew?
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
Why?
What is that supposed to mean?
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
Thank you.
A year? You were together for a year?
[knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!
OK!
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
We are closed! Come on.
[quietly] Is this a joke?
We're pin twins.
I do really want him.
Did you write this?
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
[at vending machine] B-9.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
But you hurt your hand.
I���m so happy for you Kelly.
Never say that.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
Oh!
Yeah...
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
Do they not like me, though?
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Go!
You named them?
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
Get out of here!
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
So tell me about your new girlfriend.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
Whoa. the lights are still on.
Nice.
Super romantic.
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Jim, are you in?
Yes.
You're soaking wet.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
Oh.
We want to dance with you.
Do you even know what you're doing?
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Uhhhh, they were engaged?
Yeah! [laughs]
[shrugs] I've done it all my life.
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
She had so much -
A paper company.
