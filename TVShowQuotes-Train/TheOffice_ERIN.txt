[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Come on. I was in line before you.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
So far no one will admit to it.
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
You really think we can get that back?
I wish I had seen you do it.
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
There���s a call for you on line one.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
You have a cool place to come hang.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
None of this makes any sense to me!
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
A year? You were together for a year?
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
I want to continue working on our friendship.
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
