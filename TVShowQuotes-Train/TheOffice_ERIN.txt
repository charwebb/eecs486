You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
You really think we can get that back?
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
There���s a call for you on line one.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Come on. I was in line before you.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
A year? You were together for a year?
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
So far no one will admit to it.
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Do you want me to go back to the store?
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
You have a cool place to come hang.
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
None of this makes any sense to me!
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
I wish I had seen you do it.
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
Wait, why do you have to record it?
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
I did. I got some really good sleep.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
