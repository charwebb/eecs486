That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
I want to continue working on our friendship.
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
I wish I had seen you do it.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
A year? You were together for a year?
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
None of this makes any sense to me!
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
You really think we can get that back?
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
There���s a call for you on line one.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
I, really don't like spending time with him.
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
Come on. I was in line before you.
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Wait, why do you have to record it?
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
You have a cool place to come hang.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
So far no one will admit to it.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
