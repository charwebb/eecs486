Nono! I mean, where would she be staying?
When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the univese. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.
No, no. Just the lead singer.  Oh! Ah!
I've got to go after Mecha Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number!
We must tell him that her weak point is the nose.
Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?
Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.
Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B.
Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets ahold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!
More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.
I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbra Streisand recently?
Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are.
Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere.
Have you ever heard of the band called, The Cure?
She's close! She's very close-I can feel her.
Oh no! No! She has joned the two triangles?
Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?
If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?
