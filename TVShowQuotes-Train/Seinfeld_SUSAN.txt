Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Can we stop by a drug store first?
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Renting a video! What do you got there?
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
I thought you two guys were working today.
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
So, have you picked out a name yet?
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
So, did you get to talk to her?
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
