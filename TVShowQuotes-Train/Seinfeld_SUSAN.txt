Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
Can we stop by a drug store first?
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
I thought you two guys were working today.
So, did you get to talk to her?
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
Renting a video! What do you got there?
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
So, have you picked out a name yet?
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
