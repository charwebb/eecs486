I don't like this one bit.
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
Oh. What kinda chips?
Hey, where're you going?
What kind of problems are they having?
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
Whoo.
So, what does he uh, import?
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
Oh, I don't know.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Ah, George.
Hi, how was your day?
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
So, what colour?
Uhh.. about the cabin..
I'll speak to you later.
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
Yeah, look who I ran into.
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
You're an idiot.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
Ehahh, forget it.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
Stop it! Let go of him!
Come on George. George stop. George.
Hi, Jerry.
It's not a name. It's a number.
A little baby girl?
Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
No. Susan.
Why not?
My cycles?
Oh, stop it.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
What is that? Sign language?
I have no doubt George. Do you?
Yeah, just tell me your code.
Daddy..
Mmm-hmm.
Who's that?
Aww.
Well, I, (phone rings)
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
George!
Oh, how could he be so vain?
Yeah.
David Letterman's on the floor?
Well now what are you gonna do?
So, did you get to talk to her?
Here give it to me.
Well, you've never been a couple.
Why don't they make'em anymore?
People don't change.
Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
(laugh) I can't give you his address.
Ah.
Alright.
Give it back!
Aww!
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
Well you are gonna have to quit.
Yes.
Yeah. Call me.
Thank you, honey.
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
Eurk.. Awful
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
Yes.
George?
David
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
O.K.
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
Oh, it was only vomit.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
(happily) Thank you.
Those were his exact words.
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
Maya Angelou, the poet.
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
What?
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
How do you like the Merlot?
The what?
(Solemn) No. Nothing.
Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
Yeah, we got along real well.
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Does he have the address?
 The third?
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
What's the premise?
Are you having an affair with Elaine?
Ah, no. I don't think so.
Oh those are the invitations.
Name one.
You okay?
Since when do you smoke?
Mmm-hmm.
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
Hmmm?
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
There was a fire, and it uh..
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
The what?
Well, it's gone.
You don't love me.
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
Uh, hello?
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
No.
Well, the thing is..
Hey! Congratulations!
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
Why?
I'm going to the ladies room.
How was your day?
The vault?
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
Hey!
Well, where does he live?
(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
Hi.
What about him?
Cultivate it?
Wanna check out a swap meet?
Seven Costanza? You're serious?
So, have you picked out a name yet?
Art Vandelay?
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
I *know* who I'm talking to.
Can we stop by a drug store first?
Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.
Did you like it?
Mmm.
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
Come on, George, just tear it open.
You think so?
Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
So what did Jerry have to say?
No.
I don't think so.
Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
Hey George!
George, better get ready.
More wine anyone?
Yu - you're passing?
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
It's awful. I hate it!
Hi.
Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
I've never seen you smoke.
They're gonna name their baby Seven.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Smoke.
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
Anything else?
Not really. (Walks away)
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
..So you're telling me the truth?
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
George, it's a doll.
Come on, just once?
Mmm-hmm.
You'll have to wait til Monday.
Hey, Jerry.
I'm out of birth control stuff.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
And what does he export?
yeah! Thank you.
What's a bubble boy?
So what? You are SUCH a prude.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
Yeah.
Yes. She's in *love* with him.
Who is it?
Off the market? The sponge?
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
Yeah.
Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
Whadda doing?
Really?
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
Just once...for the make-up sex.
Oh, the poet!
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
You said it was insulting.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
What is it?
Kramer!
I thought you two guys were working today.
Aw, what are you getting George?
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Yeah.
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
I think I know my own name.
Uh-huh.
Nice to meet you...
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
Okay, Come on lets go in.
Can we change the subject, please?
I need someone a little more stable.
You wearing that shirt?.
GEORGE? GEORGE, what is it?
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
What?
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
Ted Danson?
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
So, was George helpful at all?
Hi!
Well, what about the flyers?
I don't know. Where'd you put it?
Since you and I broke up.
What's the matter?
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
So, what have you got there?
Stop it. Let go of him!
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
Renting a video! What do you got there?
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Hello.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Why?
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
I liked women?
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
Why were there so many cockroaches?
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
It's a long story.
The importing.
Yeah, sure.
(walks in) George?
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
There's no doubt.
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
Yeah.
Jerry.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
(To George) Daddy never laughs.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
I can't believe that they're using it.
She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
A pre-nup?
He doesn't even know my name.
Elaine? What for?
(burst out laughing)
Oh.
Are you sure?
"The hell with them."
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
So what does he do?
What?
Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
Daddy, about the cabin..
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
George?
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
What are you talking about?
You do? What?
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
Aww, that's too bad.
Well, you just tear it open.
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
Oh, no! That's too bad.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Hello?
I-I-I have no story.
Hello.
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
Hi. Here's your cash, George.
What are you talking about?
Bye.
Well, it was eighteen dollars.
I'm not a soft boiled egg.
(bright) George, we'll go.
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
June
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
You're very sweet...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Yeah.
Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
Tear it.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
