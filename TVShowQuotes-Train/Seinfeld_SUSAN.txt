Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
I thought you two guys were working today.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
Can we stop by a drug store first?
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
So, did you get to talk to her?
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
So, have you picked out a name yet?
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
Renting a video! What do you got there?
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
