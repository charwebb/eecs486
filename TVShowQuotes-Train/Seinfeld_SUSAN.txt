Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
Bye.
Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
Aww!
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
Wanna check out a swap meet?
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
You wearing that shirt?.
What?
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
What about him?
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
Yeah.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
Why?
(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
Thank you, honey.
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
Renting a video! What do you got there?
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
What kind of problems are they having?
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
Ted Danson?
David
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
This is Mona.
(burst out laughing)
There's no doubt.
Yeah.
There was a fire, and it uh..
But you told me anyway?
GEORGE? GEORGE, what is it?
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
It's a long story.
Hi.
Yes. She's in *love* with him.
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
Seven Costanza? You're serious?
Anything else?
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
Yeah.
(happily) Thank you.
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
Name one.
What are you talking about?
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
Why not?
Who's that?
I-I-I have no story.
Oh, stop it.
Uh, hello?
Why were there so many cockroaches?
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
You don't love me.
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
George?
What's the premise?
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
Hi. Here's your cash, George.
I need someone a little more stable.
Come on George. George stop. George.
Oh. What kinda chips?
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
Come on, George, just tear it open.
Okay, Come on lets go in.
Why?
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
It's awful. I hate it!
Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
What?
Yeah.
Hey, Jerry.
George!
Yeah. So what?
Aww, that's too bad.
Pounded on his desk.
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
Just get me some sponges, please.
I didn't see them George.
(bright) George, we'll go.
Yeah.
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
It's not a name. It's a number.
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
Oh, the poet!
Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Are you having an affair with Elaine?
I'm out of birth control stuff.
Oh, no! That's too bad.
Because he's a security guard.
So, did you get to talk to her?
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
(not convinced) Yeah.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Hello.
Well, what about the flyers?
Ah, George.
Of course.
(To George) Daddy never laughs.
Hey George!
What is it?
You okay?
 The third?
Art Vandelay?
You said it was insulting.
He doesn't even know my name.
Well, it's gone.
What's that Jerry?
Oh, it was only vomit.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
A little baby girl?
(Solemn) No. Nothing.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
Ehahh, forget it.
Yeah, sure.
Hi!
Yeah.
Just once...for the make-up sex.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
Smoke.
All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Well now what are you gonna do?
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
Does he have the address?
The vault?
No.
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
Fine, it's good to see you.
Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
Daddy..
Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
George, it's a doll.
No. Susan.
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
George, better get ready.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
Would you two, Please?
Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
Well, the thing is..
Hi.
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
Daddy, about the cabin..
Mmm-hmm.
Whadda doing?
I think I know my own name.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
Not really. (Walks away)
I have no doubt George. Do you?
Ah.
More wine anyone?
And what does he export?
Kramer!
So, have you picked out a name yet?
Whoo.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
Hey! Congratulations!
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
Nice to meet you...
The what?
Well, I, (phone rings)
Oh.
How was your day?
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
Yeah. Call me.
You'll have to wait til Monday.
You don't want to go?
Yeah, just tell me your code.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, look who I ran into.
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
GEORGE, I'm starting it.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
I'm going to the ladies room.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
Well, you've never been a couple.
Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
(Rushing in) What? What is it?
I don't like this one bit.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
What?
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
No.
Tear it.
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
I liked women?
Huh?
Well you are gonna have to quit.
My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
Hey, where're you going?
Hi, how was your day?
Elaine? What for?
Hey, Jerry!
I can't believe that they're using it.
So what? You are SUCH a prude.
Stop it. Let go of him!
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
Yes.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
Hey!
Oh, I don't know.
Eurk.. Awful
So, what have you got there?
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
Off the market? The sponge?
Alright.
They're gonna name their baby Seven.
Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
So what does he do?
So, was George helpful at all?
The importing.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
..So you're telling me the truth?
What is that? Sign language?
Jerry.
Hello.
Do it. Come on, Jerry.
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
You do? What?
(walks in) George?
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
Well you could use a little flash.
What's the matter?
David Letterman's on the floor?
Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
And they got along?
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
Why?
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Can we stop by a drug store first?
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
(laugh) I can't give you his address.
Who is it?
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
So, what colour?
I'll speak to you later.
Well, where does he live?
You're very sweet...
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
Come on, just once?
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
So what did Jerry have to say?
I'm not a soft boiled egg.
I thought you two guys were working today.
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
Yes.
Can we change the subject, please?
Oh those are the invitations.
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Well, you just tear it open.
The what?
(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
I don't think so.
Hi, Jerry.
Really?
Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''
(warning) George!
Since you and I broke up.
So, what does he uh, import?
Ah, no. I don't think so.
A pre-nup?
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
Stop it! Let go of him!
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
Mmm-hmm.
People don't change.
"The hell with them."
June
Yeah, we got along real well.
You're an idiot.
Those were his exact words.
Yeah.
Yu - you're passing?
My cycles?
Well, it was eighteen dollars.
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
Hello?
I *know* who I'm talking to.
How do you like the Merlot?
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Why don't they make'em anymore?
Since when do you smoke?
Maya Angelou, the poet.
Hmmm?
