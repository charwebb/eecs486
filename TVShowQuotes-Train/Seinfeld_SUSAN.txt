Yes.
Just get me some sponges, please.
Hi!
They're gonna name their baby Seven.
What is that? Sign language?
Stop it! Let go of him!
You think so?
What?
George!
Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
Oh, the poet!
O.K.
Wanna check out a swap meet?
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
(Rushing in) What? What is it?
Who is it?
Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
Just once...for the make-up sex.
Oh, how could he be so vain?
Aww!
Ted Danson?
Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
Thank you, honey.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
What?
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
So what does he do?
So, what colour?
Name one.
It's not a name. It's a number.
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
Come on, George, just tear it open.
GEORGE, I'm starting it.
(happily) Thank you.
So, did you get to talk to her?
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
My cycles?
Oh. What kinda chips?
Hello?
How do you like the Merlot?
I don't know. Where'd you put it?
I'm not a soft boiled egg.
Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
How was your day?
Well, the thing is..
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
Ah.
Tear it.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
Can we change the subject, please?
So, what have you got there?
What's the matter?
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
So, what does he uh, import?
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
Really?
So what? You are SUCH a prude.
Bye.
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
I-I-I have no story.
Cultivate it?
Nice to meet you...
Mmm-hmm.
Whoo.
(laugh) I can't give you his address.
I need someone a little more stable.
Oh.
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
I didn't see them George.
Hey!
yeah! Thank you.
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
Mmm-hmm.
You don't love me.
(warning) George!
Alright.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
I've never seen you smoke.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
Why?
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
Renting a video! What do you got there?
Those were his exact words.
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
Uh-huh.
Well, it's gone.
No.
(walks in) George?
Since you and I broke up.
A pre-nup?
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
Does he have the address?
So, was George helpful at all?
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
What?
Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
There's no doubt.
What's that Jerry?
Yeah. Call me.
Well you could use a little flash.
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
You don't want to go?
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
Seven Costanza? You're serious?
What's a bubble boy?
Yeah.
What about him?
You said it was insulting.
Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
Yeah, look who I ran into.
Uhh.. about the cabin..
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
Are you sure?
Not really. (Walks away)
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
Hey, where're you going?
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
Are you having an affair with Elaine?
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Art Vandelay?
Hi. Here's your cash, George.
I don't like this one bit.
Why?
Eurk.. Awful
Can I talk to you for a minute?
..So you're telling me the truth?
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Kramer!
Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
Ah, George.
Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
(not convinced) Yeah.
(bright) George, we'll go.
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
Fine, it's good to see you.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
Mmm.
Hi.
More wine anyone?
George, better get ready.
David Letterman's on the floor?
(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
Hey! Congratulations!
(Solemn) No. Nothing.
Why were there so many cockroaches?
Ah, no. I don't think so.
Hi, how was your day?
It's awful. I hate it!
Stop it. Let go of him!
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
Give it back!
What's the premise?
You're an idiot.
Why don't they make'em anymore?
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Yeah. So what?
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
I'm out of birth control stuff.
A little baby girl?
"The hell with them."
David
Yeah.
Yes. She's in *love* with him.
Well now what are you gonna do?
You'll have to wait til Monday.
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
George?
George?
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
Thank you...
Yes.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Well you are gonna have to quit.
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
And they got along?
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
Well, you just tear it open.
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
And what does he export?
Yu - you're passing?
Pounded on his desk.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
You wearing that shirt?.
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
Daddy, about the cabin..
Do it. Come on, Jerry.
Come on George. George stop. George.
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Hey, Jerry.
I liked women?
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
Of course.
Here give it to me.
So, have you picked out a name yet?
Huh?
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
I'm going to the ladies room.
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
There was a fire, and it uh..
Who's that?
Oh, I don't know.
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
What are you talking about?
Anything else?
Well, you've never been a couple.
Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
Daddy..
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
I can't believe that they're using it.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
Oh those are the invitations.
Hey, Jerry!
Okay, Come on lets go in.
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
No.
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
Yeah.
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
I don't think so.
She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
Why not?
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
 The third?
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
The importing.
Aww.
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.
(burst out laughing)
Hey George!
It's a long story.
What is it?
June
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
Hi, Jerry.
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
I have no doubt George. Do you?
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
Oh, stop it.
Did you like it?
Hi.
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
Come on, just once?
What kind of problems are they having?
Elaine? What for?
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
Maya Angelou, the poet.
Smoke.
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
Since when do you smoke?
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Uh, hello?
Would you two, Please?
IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?
What are you talking about?
I *know* who I'm talking to.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
Whadda doing?
Yeah.
(To George) Daddy never laughs.
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
He doesn't even know my name.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Aww, that's too bad.
Well, it was eighteen dollars.
The what?
So what did Jerry have to say?
I think I know my own name.
Yeah, just tell me your code.
Because he's a security guard.
Well, I, (phone rings)
GEORGE? GEORGE, what is it?
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
Hello.
Why?
Hello.
Jerry.
Oh, it was only vomit.
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
The vault?
Aw, what are you getting George?
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
Off the market? The sponge?
