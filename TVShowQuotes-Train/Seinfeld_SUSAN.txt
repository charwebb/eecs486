What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Can we stop by a drug store first?
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
I thought you two guys were working today.
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
So, have you picked out a name yet?
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
Renting a video! What do you got there?
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
I just don't think we have anything in common.
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
So, did you get to talk to her?
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
