What about him?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
How was your day?
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
What is that? Sign language?
Oh, stop it.
David
Give it back!
Hi, how was your day?
I *know* who I'm talking to.
I'm not a soft boiled egg.
You wearing that shirt?.
Thank you, honey.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
GEORGE, I'm starting it.
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
Do it. Come on, Jerry.
Just once...for the make-up sex.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
You're an idiot.
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
Hey, Jerry!
Daddy, about the cabin..
George?
Aww.
Can we stop by a drug store first?
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
Yeah, sure.
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
It's not a name. It's a number.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
June
(laugh) I can't give you his address.
It's a long story.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
So, what have you got there?
George, better get ready.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Not really. (Walks away)
Come on, just once?
Yes.
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
Jerry.
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
Here give it to me.
George?
Tear it.
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
The what?
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
Kramer!
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
Oh.
Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?
Does he have the address?
Hey, Jerry.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
Yeah.
Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.
Okay, Come on lets go in.
Of course.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
Hey! Congratulations!
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
You okay?
Stop it. Let go of him!
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
Yeah. Call me.
Elaine? What for?
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
Hey!
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
Well, you just tear it open.
(burst out laughing)
Cultivate it?
I don't know. Where'd you put it?
Oh, how could he be so vain?
I-I-I have no story.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
Yeah. So what?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
My cycles?
Huh?
Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Oh, no! That's too bad.
Ehahh, forget it.
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
He doesn't even know my name.
I liked women?
Yeah.
What kind of problems are they having?
Well, what about the flyers?
Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
I want you to tell me, George.
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
(warning) George!
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
Really?
Hello.
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
Smoke.
Yeah, look who I ran into.
Aw, what are you getting George?
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
Oh those are the invitations.
No. Susan.
Are you sure?
How do you like the Merlot?
Who is it?
Why were there so many cockroaches?
Seven Costanza? You're serious?
I can't believe that they're using it.
Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
I've never seen you smoke.
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
Eurk.. Awful
Yu - you're passing?
I think I know my own name.
So what? You are SUCH a prude.
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
So, was George helpful at all?
Whoo.
Why don't they make'em anymore?
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Come on George. George stop. George.
Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
(not convinced) Yeah.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
Hey, where're you going?
You think so?
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
Because he's a security guard.
Are you having an affair with Elaine?
A pre-nup?
So what did Jerry have to say?
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Why not?
What's a bubble boy?
So, have you picked out a name yet?
What's the premise?
Oh, it was only vomit.
I have no doubt George. Do you?
But you told me anyway?
And what does he export?
What?
Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
Why?
Well, you've never been a couple.
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
What are you talking about?
IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
No.
Fine, it's good to see you.
The what?
Hi.
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
People don't change.
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Did you like it?
Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.
What?
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Aww!
You'll have to wait til Monday.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh. What kinda chips?
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
You don't want to go?
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
No.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
Well you are gonna have to quit.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
So, what colour?
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Hello?
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
Ah, George.
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
(To George) Daddy never laughs.
I didn't see them George.
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Maya Angelou, the poet.
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
They're gonna name their baby Seven.
Can we change the subject, please?
You do? What?
..So you're telling me the truth?
I need someone a little more stable.
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
It's awful. I hate it!
GEORGE? GEORGE, what is it?
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
Yeah.
Hey George!
Oh, the poet!
Hi.
I'll speak to you later.
Nice to meet you...
Who's that?
Renting a video! What do you got there?
The importing.
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
Well now what are you gonna do?
Uhh.. about the cabin..
Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
Bye.
Uh, hello?
Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
Well, the thing is..
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
You said it was insulting.
"The hell with them."
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
So, what does he uh, import?
Just get me some sponges, please.
You don't love me.
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Daddy..
Yes.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
So what does he do?
What is it?
(walks in) George?
Pounded on his desk.
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
Yeah.
Well, I, (phone rings)
Since when do you smoke?
Aww, that's too bad.
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
Hi. Here's your cash, George.
Yes. She's in *love* with him.
Stop it! Let go of him!
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
I don't like this one bit.
 The third?
Why?
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
David Letterman's on the floor?
Yeah.
George, it's a doll.
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
The vault?
Hi, Jerry.
Hi!
Would you two, Please?
You're very sweet...
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
(bright) George, we'll go.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
Why?
Off the market? The sponge?
Anything else?
Well, it's gone.
There's no doubt.
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
What are you talking about?
She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
Hello.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
Since you and I broke up.
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
Wanna check out a swap meet?
What's that Jerry?
Yeah, just tell me your code.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
George!
Alright.
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
Yeah.
(happily) Thank you.
Mmm.
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
Hmmm?
(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
I just don't think we have anything in common.
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
Well, where does he live?
There was a fire, and it uh..
So, did you get to talk to her?
Thank you...
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
I don't think so.
Whadda doing?
Uh-huh.
I thought you two guys were working today.
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
More wine anyone?
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
Ted Danson?
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
Well, it was eighteen dollars.
Name one.
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
