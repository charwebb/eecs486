What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.

Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.

No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.

Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?

What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?

What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.

Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 

Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.

O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.

There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?

All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.

Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?

Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.

Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 

Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.

Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce go on.  .

I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...  Now, shop friends. Shop! 

Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?

The kid is right. This has gone on too long.

Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.

It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!

Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.

Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.

People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! 

Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.

It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.

Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation".

Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? 

Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?

Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.

Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.

She must be back at the train station; come on! 

Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?

Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer.
