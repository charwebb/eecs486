It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!

May I help you find something?

Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. 

Who?? No!

Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?

Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.

Wow. What?

That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.

Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.

Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?

Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.

There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?

There's none left, don't you understand?!

Oh great, go right on in. 

Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?

We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"

"Whoever denied it,  supplied it." 

Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.

She must be back at the train station; come on! 

What? Hey. Who are you? 

Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 

What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?

So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?

Chicken sandwich?

Thank you.

People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! 

It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.

Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce go on.  .

The kid is right. This has gone on too long.

Fools. Ignorant fools.

E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.

Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.

Oh. What?

Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!

Not so loud! It can hear you.

What?? ...No.

Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.

Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. 

Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? 

Wow. That was your best? 

Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.

Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?

Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?

O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.

Can I help you?

Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.

Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!

Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.

Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.

Oh. Okay. 

No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.

Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.

Sorry. Get out! 

What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.

Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?

Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 

Any what?

Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks. 

Hey. This video is dumb.

That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!
