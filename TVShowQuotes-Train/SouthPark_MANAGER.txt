Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 
Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.
Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.
Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.
That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...  Now, shop friends. Shop! 
We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"
What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks. 
Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 
Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce go on.  .
There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?
She must be back at the train station; come on! 
O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.
The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.
People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! 
Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.
What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.
Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.
Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? 
Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.
Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. 
Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation".
Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.
Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.
Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
