Fools. Ignorant fools.

That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!

It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.

Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.

Oh great, go right on in. 

Wow. That was your best? 

Thank you.

Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?

May I help you find something?

Any what?

Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce go on.  .

What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.

Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.

Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. 

It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!

Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?

O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.

Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?

What? Hey. Who are you? 

Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.

The kid is right. This has gone on too long.

Alright, that's enough!

Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.

Oh. What?

Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.

Who?? No!

What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.

Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.

Hey. This video is dumb.

Chicken sandwich?

I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...  Now, shop friends. Shop! 

E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.

Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 

Oh. Okay. 

Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.

Can I help you?

Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?

"Whoever denied it,  supplied it." 

What?? ...No.

She must be back at the train station; come on! 

Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!

Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.

Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.

No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.

Not so loud! It can hear you.

That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.

What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?

So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?

Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?

Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation".

Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks. 

Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? 

There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?

Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.

Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. 

Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!

There's none left, don't you understand?!

Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?

Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 

Only for twenty minutes, though.
