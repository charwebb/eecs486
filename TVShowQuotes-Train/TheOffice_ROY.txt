Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
Hey! Guys, what's going on?
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
Ah, thank you!
Chicken or fish?
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
[screams in pain] Ahh God!
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
You don't know?
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
So I only use three?
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
What the hell man?
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
Yeah? Get you a drink.
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
Yeah?
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
What's up?
I thought you were a friend.
Sure.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
No, it was Captain Jack.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
What? Iverson's not fat.
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
Don't yell?!
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
What's the problem?
Crazy day, huh?
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
I can read you like a book.
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
[looks around conference room] You're joking right?
Hey Halpert!
No, you take it easy.
What does that mean?
Yeah?
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
Huh.
Boys R Us!
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags?
You look good.
Should have done it a long time ago.
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
I think you might be able to.
All right, let's go.
Yeah.
Come on!
Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Thanks...aw.
Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Nope.
Natural redhead.
Really?
Come on, you mad at me?
Jet ski money?
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
Why don't you get on that?
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
Yeah.
You good?
In my truck.
Absolutely.
All right, I'll see ya.
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
Are you still mad at me now?
Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
Hey.
All right.
Halpert?
Jim came on to you?
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
That's what I'm talking about.
Okay.
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
Really?
So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
[laughing] I think he's dancing.
Hey babe.  Hey, how are you!?
What's going on with Pam?
Like next to no benefits.
Little package!
You think you can beat up Darryl?
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
OK.
...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
This is awesome.
What?
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
[laughs] Congrats, man.
Why?
I'm good.
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
So how's your day going?
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
Are they going to call the cops?
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]
How's that union stuff coming?
Are you still mad at me?
Hey there.
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
How are you likin' the new car?
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
No!
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
You look like you feel bad.
Exactly.
You look nice.
See you.
You almost ready to go?
Yeah!
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
She took you down, huh?
Yeah! That's great.
Oh, no. That is not worth it.
Come on.
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
So you havin' a good day?
Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
That's disgusting.
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[at Roy���s wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What���s happening?
I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
Good, glad.  OK.
Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
Oh, cool.
That's her?
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
I don't understand.
You can't keep anything from me.
What?
What's wrong?
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
On this side.
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
Sweet.
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
Hey Darryl, what's happenin'?
At the party?
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
Never.
Pam. Go.
Sweet. All right.
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
How are ya?
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
Hey baby.
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
You ready?
Hey, they're playing our song.
So, we're cool, right?
Hey, what's up, guys? How you been?
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
Come on.
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
That's awesome. That's what I want.
Ok.
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
Hey.
Love ya.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
Are you kidding?
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Are you mad at me now?
Hey, hey, hey.
Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
[on video] Yes.
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
[laughs] Cool, all right.
What are you gay?
I can't for your art show tonight.
Hey, baby.
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
You're all gay.
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
You look great!
[walking into the break room] Hey.
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
Engaged, yeah.
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
No.
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
No problem.
