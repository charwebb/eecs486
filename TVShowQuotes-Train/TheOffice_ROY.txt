What are you gay?
Hey Halpert!
Hey! Guys, what's going on?
Love ya.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
[looks around conference room] You're joking right?
I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hey babe.
Like next to no benefits.
So I only use three?
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
You look great!
[walking into the break room] Hey.
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
Never.
How are ya?
What does that mean?
You ready?
On this side.
See you.
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
Hey baby.
Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
[at Roy���s wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What���s happening?
Are you kidding?
No, you take it easy.
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
This is awesome.
OK.
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
Sure.
[laughs] Congrats, man.
All right.
What the hell man?
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
Hey babe.  Hey, how are you!?
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
Good, glad.  OK.
[laughing] I think he's dancing.
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
What, you're mad at me?
Hey, they're playing our song.
Really?
All right, I'll see ya.
Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
How's that union stuff coming?
Hey.
Jim came on to you?
Yeah.
All right, let's go.
Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
Where did you go to school?
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
Are you still mad at me?
Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Ah, thank you!
[laughs] Cool, all right.
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
You're all gay.
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
Come on!
What? Iverson's not fat.
No!
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
What's the problem?
So you havin' a good day?
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
That's disgusting.
Yeah?
Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
You almost ready to go?
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
I thought you were a friend.
Absolutely.
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags?
Come on.
So, we're cool, right?
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
He's in the office.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
Huh.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Are you mad at me now?
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Hey, what's up, guys? How you been?
[on video] Yes.
Engaged, yeah.
To my place?
Jet ski money?
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
What's up?
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
Sweet. All right.
I don't understand.
Yeah?
Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Pam. Go.
Come on, you mad at me?
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
Hey, hey, hey.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
Why?
Come on [begins to tickle Pam]
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
That's her?
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
You can't keep anything from me.
That's what I'm talking about.
You look good.
What's wrong?
I think you might be able to.
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
Oh, no. That is not worth it.
What?
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
Hey.
Yeah.
You think you can beat up Darryl?
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
Yeah! That's great.
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
Hey Darryl, what's happenin'?
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
How are you likin' the new car?
Oh, cool.
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
Ok.
In my truck.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
Crazy day, huh?
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
Come on.
You mean the thing?
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
Little package!
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
Natural redhead.
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
Halpert?
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
Wow.
Are you still mad at me now?
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Boys R Us!
Yeah!
Sorry about that.
So Pam's happy?
I'm good.
Yeah? Get you a drink.
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
Why don't you get on that?
Chicken or fish?
What?
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
She took you down, huh?
That's awesome. That's what I want.
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
No.
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
Really?
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
What's going on with Pam?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
[screams in pain] Ahh God!
No problem.
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
I can't for your art show tonight.
So how's your day going?
I can read you like a book.
Okay.
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
You good?
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
Exactly.
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
You look nice.
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Nope.
You don't know?
Should have done it a long time ago.
