I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
