Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
Should have done it a long time ago.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
