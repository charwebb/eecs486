But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
Should have done it a long time ago.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
