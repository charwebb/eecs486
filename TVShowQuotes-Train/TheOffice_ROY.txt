All right.
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
OK.
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
She took you down, huh?
Hey baby.
You look good.
What's the problem?
So you havin' a good day?
What the hell man?
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
What does that mean?
Are you still mad at me?
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
I'm good.
I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
To my place?
Hey, what's up, guys? How you been?
At the party?
Why?
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
Wow.
You almost ready to go?
Where did you go to school?
Okay.
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
All right, I'll see ya.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
You don't know?
Hey.
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
Yeah?
So Pam's happy?
No!
You ready?
Yeah.
I thought you were a friend.
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
What's wrong?
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
Come on, you mad at me?
What are you gay?
Never.
How's that union stuff coming?
Hey babe.
You're all gay.
Like next to no benefits.
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
Come on!
[screams in pain] Ahh God!
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
No.
How are ya?
That's what I'm talking about.
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
No, it was Captain Jack.
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
Ok.
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
[on video] Yes.
Oh, cool.
Sorry about that.
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
In my truck.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
[laughs] Congrats, man.
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Nope.
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
You look good.
Love ya.
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
See you.
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
That's disgusting.
Why don't you get on that?
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
Yeah?
Hey Halpert!
Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
Really?
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
What's going on with Pam?
Are you kidding?
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
You look nice.
...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
All right, let's go.
I think you might be able to.
How are you likin' the new car?
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
Halpert?
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
Are you still mad at me now?
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Yeah!
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
Come on.
Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
So, we're cool, right?
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
Hey there.
That's awesome. That's what I want.
Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Absolutely.
I don't understand.
Hey.
You good?
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
That's what I'm talking about.
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
Yeah, let's get out of here.
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
Hey babe.  Hey, how are you!?
Don't yell?!
Pam. Go.
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
Ah, thank you!
Are they going to call the cops?
Hey, hey, hey.
Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags?
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
[at Roy���s wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What���s happening?
[laughs] Cool, all right.
Thanks...aw.
Little package!
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
Yeah.
No, you take it easy.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
[walking into the break room] Hey.
So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
Come on.
Jim came on to you?
You can't keep anything from me.
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
I can read you like a book.
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
Hey, baby.
Hey Darryl, what's happenin'?
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
Good, glad.  OK.
Sure.
What?
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
You mean the thing?
Natural redhead.
You look like you feel bad.
Sweet. All right.
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
Boys R Us!
Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
Should have done it a long time ago.
Hey! Guys, what's going on?
What? Iverson's not fat.
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
Really?
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
Yeah? Get you a drink.
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
He's in the office.
You look great!
What's up?
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
Jet ski money?
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
What, you're mad at me?
Oh, no. That is not worth it.
[laughing] I think he's dancing.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
On this side.
Exactly.
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
I can't for your art show tonight.
Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Sweet.
Yeah.
This is awesome.
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
What?
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
[looks around conference room] You're joking right?
That's her?
No problem.
Come on [begins to tickle Pam]
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
