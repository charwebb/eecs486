Murderer!
Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?
Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?
That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.
And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.
(again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.
Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.
We know.
(Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go)
The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?!
They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.
What are their names?
You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
Ask Rusty.
What?
(walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.
Burned?
Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up!
They put it up this morning.
It's March.
Where are we, George?
You'll be on the board of directors.
(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.
Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?
Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, w-what was it, dear?
I think it's the horse.
Yes?
How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?
Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
Another solarium?
And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.
(Gruff) A slight resemblance.
It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
What? What is it?
We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.
When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)
Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.
Yes.
I didn't care much for his jokes.
Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.
(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.
Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?
George.
George, we were just talking about you.
Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.
All right! Let's head back.
