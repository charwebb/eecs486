Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.
When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)
(walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.
That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.
You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, w-what was it, dear?
(again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.
And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.
How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?
It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?
We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.
(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.
(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?
Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.
And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.
You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?
Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.
And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.
Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?
What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.
Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up!
