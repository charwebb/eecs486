It's March.
You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?!
Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?
And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.
They put it up this morning.
(again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.
What?
Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
Another solarium?
Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?
(Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go)
(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.
(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?
Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.
Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.
Where are we, George?
Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?
Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.
What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.
Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?
What?
What are their names?
And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.
Yes.
When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)
I didn't care much for his jokes.
Murderer!
Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.
We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?
George, we were just talking about you.
(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.
You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
(Gruff) A slight resemblance.
Ask Rusty.
All right! Let's head back.
What? What is it?
Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
I think it's the horse.
All right.
Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up!
And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.
(walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.
Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, w-what was it, dear?
Yes?
George.
We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.
It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
(To Susan) What about it?
You'll be on the board of directors.
