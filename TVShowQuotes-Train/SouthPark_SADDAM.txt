What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?
I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 
You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.
Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 
Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!
Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
I know how to solve this little problem.
Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 
Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!
Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 
You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.
Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.
Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk. 
No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! 
Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 
Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!
Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 
There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 
Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?
An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!
Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.
COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!
These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! 
Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.
Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
