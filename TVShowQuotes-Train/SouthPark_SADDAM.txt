There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.

What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.

Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.

Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! 

Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.

Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.

Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?

Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 

Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!

No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! 

COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!

Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.

Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?

Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!

Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 

Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.

Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?

Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!

Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.

And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 

Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.

Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?

I know how to solve this little problem.

You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!

You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.

An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!

Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?

I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 

Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.

You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! 

These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.

Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!

Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 

Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 

Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.

Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 

Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!

Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!

You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.

Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!

Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!

For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 

D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!

Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
