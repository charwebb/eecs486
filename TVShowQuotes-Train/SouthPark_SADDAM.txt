Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.

Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?

Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?

Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!

Die, pussy! 

I know how to solve this little problem.

Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!

You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!

I thought I killed you!

Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!

Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.

There you are!

Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you know we belong together.

Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!

Die, pussy! 

Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 

Aggghhh! 

No, no, relax there, fella! 

Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?

What took yo so long, baby?

Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!

Aagghh! 

Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.

Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon.

Ey, who the hell are you?

Here, have another drink. 

Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk. 

I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 

I'm from Iraq.

Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Oh, really?

Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 

You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! 

Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!

Would you like a drink?

Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 

What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.

Hello, Satan! 

Oh. You didn't? Heeyy, relax!

Hello, Satan! 

Ah hahaha!

Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.

Right, right.

An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!

Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.

You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.

He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.

What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!

Hey!! What the hell is this?! 

Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!

Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! 

Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 

Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!

For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 

Eh! Who are you?

There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.

Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 

Aw, you little..prick!

Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.

Is this some kind of trick?

No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! 

These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.

Screw him!!

Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.

Did you miss me, buttercup?

Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.

Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!

And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 

Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me! 

Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.

You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.

D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!

Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?

Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
