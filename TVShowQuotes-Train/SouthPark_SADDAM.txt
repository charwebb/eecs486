You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.

Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon.

Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.

Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 

Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk. 

You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!

For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 

Aw, you little..prick!

Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!

Uh huh.

Ah hahaha!

COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!

What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.

Die, pussy! 

Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! 

Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?

Ey, who the hell are you?

Aagghh! 

Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.

There you are!

Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?

You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.

I thought I killed you!

Oh, really?

You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! 

I'm from Iraq.

Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.

D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!

Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?

There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.

Hey!! What the hell is this?! 

Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.

Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!

Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.

Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!

Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me! 

Did you miss me, buttercup?

No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! 

Right, right.

Is this some kind of trick?

I know how to solve this little problem.

Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 

I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 

Would you like a drink?

Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 

What took yo so long, baby?

Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!

Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.

Die, pussy! 

Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!

No, no, relax there, fella! 

Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!

He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.

Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?

Eh! Who are you?

Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!

Hello, Satan! 

Aggghhh! 

Nothing! Relax, brother.

These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.

Screw him!!

Oh. You didn't? Heeyy, relax!

Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.

Let me in where? 

Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?

Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.

Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?

Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 

Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!

Hello, Satan! 

What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!

Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!

Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.

Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 

An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
