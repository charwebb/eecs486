Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!
What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!
Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 
Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?
D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?
Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! 
No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! 
And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 
Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 
COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!
I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!
Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you know we belong together.
Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 
Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!
Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
I know how to solve this little problem.
Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.
Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 
You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.
Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!
Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk. 
These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 
Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.
