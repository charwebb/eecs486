COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!
Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 
You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.
Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! 
Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you know we belong together.
An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk. 
Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.
Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 
And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.
Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!
There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 
He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.
Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!
Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 
You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.
Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!
Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 
These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.
Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!
Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 
You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!
