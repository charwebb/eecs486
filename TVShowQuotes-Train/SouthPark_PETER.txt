Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner.
Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain? 
You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?
Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command.
Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!
He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.
You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car? 
Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.
Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis
Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.
Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!
This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.
We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea.
There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you.
My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes!  Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide!  I'm talking of course about  murder porn!
Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.
The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe.
Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much.
No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-
Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter.
You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?
