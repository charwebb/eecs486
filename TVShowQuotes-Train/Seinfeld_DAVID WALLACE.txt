[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
[enters] Hey guys.
Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?
Hey.
It's probably a little of both.
Sometimes, we-- [Michael hangs up phone]
[leaving] Great job, everybody!
Where?
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
Hey, Dwight. It���s David.
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
Very good.
Excuse me?
What?
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
What are you talking about?
What fire?
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ���
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Andy���
OK.
Jim says he���d like some say in the hiring process.
Well, thanks Dwight.
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
200
I know.
Got your per diem?
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
It looked fine to me.
Yeah.
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
Yeah. What���s up Jim?
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
[preparing to leave] Thanks, Andy.
I don���t think so.
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
You could have burned down the whole building.
So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
[On phone] Hello?
Why do you already have this?
...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Dwight?
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Michael?
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers.
Will you be the new manager?
What?
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
Yeah? Are you ok?
Well, good luck.
No, we are mad.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
It���s okay. Go ahead, Jim.
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Excuse me?
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Enough, Andy. Enough!
[on speakerphone] Do you have your passport?
[on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Okay.
Oh my god.
350
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
This is weird.
Jim, what the hell is happening there?
Michael, the... that's for your food.
Yeah.
Well that kind of worked out.
No, we're not.
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Yeah.
The hotel? What, M--- okay.
Dwight?
It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
Uh-huh, but���
Yeah.
