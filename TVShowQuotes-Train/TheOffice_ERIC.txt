It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.
Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits.
Thank you. It's nice to meet you all.
What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that?
I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.
If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.
Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?
Is anyone near retirement age? [Michael and Toby look at each other - Creed clip montage]
[on the phone] Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile.
Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here.
