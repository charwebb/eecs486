Thank you. It's nice to meet you all.
[on the phone] Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile.
What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that?
It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.
So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character.
Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?
If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.
Is anyone near retirement age? [Michael and Toby look at each other - Creed clip montage]
I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.
Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here.
