Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?
O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-
That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job.
It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island.  Now drink the chi-chi! 
The haoles are trying to do away with us.
Are all the tourists gone from our island?
Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.
I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island! 
There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower.Â 
Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.
Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?
I knew one day it would come to this.
