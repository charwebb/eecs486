Everyone! Changed my mind again.
You're gonna lose all of our money.
Costume vetoed.
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
Fine. I will give you one minute.
Russell, I���m dressed like George Michael.
Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs]
But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food.
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
But you're calling me a liar.
Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
I did, I felt it.
I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
They had, uh��� weapons.
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
So... how was lunch?
[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
And one for you.
Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I���ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
Might've done. And how��� do you figure?
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
Let���s ink���my stink! [crowd cheers]
Oh, yeah!
...And, Jim.
OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
Not cool.
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
[laughing nervously] Yes.
Yeah, it's a kilt.
Covered it up.
Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
Question. Where's Jim?
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
Sure.
Oh!
[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
Are they on their way over?
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
Gentleman. [walks away]
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
You don���t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
... not what I meant.
Are you taking your med-meds?
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
What?
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
And you didn't invite any of us?
I would like that.
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
It was before, my tech- my technical training.
Through the use of force.
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
[points to self] This is the Nard-Dog.
Oooh.
You're right, that is new.
I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
They already have a contract? [Reading] ���Mutually agree to-��� Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what���s up? Back in the small pond?
Say what?
No, pause longer.
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
Well that's Dallas.
Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
[singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
Ah... sweet!
Um.
Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
Are you ready?
...your help. I love her.
[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
Don't worry. You're not...
That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
You're welcome.
Oh. Hmm.
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
Sorry.
Where are we in the process?
How about a little bit of this.
Partay. Room 639.
And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.
What?
Message received, little soy bean.
[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
Yeah Jim, get it out there.
Hey-o! [applauding and cheering]
Yes!
[standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.
Yeah.
Alright, I'll tell Dwight.
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
Yeah, so, I���ll see you on the red carpet. See, that���s how it works.
Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
Was that hot or what?
Shut up, Broccoli.
No!
Mmmhmmm...
Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
I bought these.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?
Saboteur!
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
[sighs] Yeah.
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
Yeah.
Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Oh... at least we can kiss now.
I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
Well it���s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
Right. Okay.
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
A-team.
I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Are we rotating seats, or?
No. No, no.
Ahhh... Is that the last of it?
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Are you saying-
This is combo number seven.
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side���s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
Thank you. [steps into conference room]
Say what?
Does anything go on top of the mouse?
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.
Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
Oop, got some blisties.
Hi, how's it going?
Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why��� Toby is giving us self defense training.
Yeah it does.
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
Here it is, you should draw a picture...
You sure it's saber?
Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
I need to talk to you in private.
Oh, really?
You're being a Thomas Oregon!
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
We're just friends, okay?
Now check the style!
[softly] Take that, kid.
I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
And a top of the day to you too, sir.
And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call���Dwight���
[through tears] Sam! Sam!
You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.
Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
[looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]
Yeah.
Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Mornin' Jim.
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
Jim! How 'bout you?
I know, right?
For four more days.
It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
He's alive.  So you're welcome.
I am the captain.
Morning.
Hey!
He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Then... what are you saying?
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
And come and tell me. Doesn���t matter what it is.
Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
Is it criminal?
Can I talk to you a minute?
Yes!  I'm in.
I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
For happy hour?
That���s my signature song.
I accidentally ate some seahorses.
I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.
Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Are they from you?
Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
Uh, dream. Goin��� with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn���t that right, Jim?
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!
[looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
David Walrus, in his native habitat.
What?!
Wha, it's-
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That���s final.
For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
Maybe you're in the ceiling!
Why would that be weird?
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
End the mistakes, easy-
All right!
Down the sides..
Do you believe in me?
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
[lying on table] Do your worst!
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.'
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Then forget I just told you that.
Nifty!
They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture���
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Have we heard of it?
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
Oh!
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn���t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ���Where were you when the girls came?���
[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?
Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together. [Andy plays video]
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
Hey-o!
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
I���ll explore exploring it.
Noishe!
Right?
You don't have a toothbrush?
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Megan Fox! Come on!
Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
Yeah. D for Andy.
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
Anything.  You can ask me anything.
Such as?
EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
Well-
It, it's, it's actually just an issue...
Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
[Dwight enters] Dwight.
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
[joking] What do I know?
Yes!  Can anyone do those?
Dwight?
What do you mean again?
Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.
This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
...and an American Express green card.
What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.
It���s now or never.
Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'
Hmm? Who? Sam?
Hail to the chief!
She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
Hey, have you guys seen her?
That sounds weird.
You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
Beer me!
[at dump] It's freezing out here.
I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
Yeah.
We had to leave because of creative differences.
Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
It was like a security blan-
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles]
I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There���s a review of the documentary!
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
What?
[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat���am i right?
[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.
Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
What!
And it was open. And people saw this. And they���re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
WHAT?
Okay.
Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
I miss her too.
I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
[drinks hand soap]
Your hands.
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Ring her up.
[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
Cool.
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
Hey.
Stop just saying that.
So bad!
Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand]
Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.
[stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.
Why should I believe that?
Okay, Tuna.
Uh, did you need something?
You're such a liar.
Hi.
The male is a funny species. We don���t just tell each other how we feel, that���s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ���Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don���t want you to leave.��� You say something like, ���Hey, Andy, you���re making the worst mistake of your life. You���re not talented.��� Well��� right back at you, Darryl.
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don���t know!.....I don���t know.
Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!
Hey.
Did you see who did it?
[sings] Time to have a little kiss!
Okay, so I-
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
Why can't I be in the club?
We're losing cloud cover.
Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
I'll call you back.
[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
Officer.
Oh my god.
G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
Where is my FREAKING phone?!
You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
WHAT??
Kaaw!
By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
That you���re learning a made-up language from HBO���s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
Seriously?
You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
Whoo.
It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
This is what���s under the blanket.
Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
Wha-
[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.
[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
You just use whichever one is sitting there?
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
Charge!
Oh, I do!
You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
Oh Man! [clapping]
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
And you will be hearing from -
Michael
Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
One came up.
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
What���s this?
That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight]
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
I don���t think she���s dead.
What are you thinking?
What?
Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
Thank you, David.
[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
You���re exactly right and you get a point.
Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
[pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]
Aw!
[on phone] Hello.
Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
I didn't tell you.
Dwight!
My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
Ok.
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
You?
Yeah. Um line 1?
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
I mean... I'm impressed.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes���
Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Aah! This ones hot too!
Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
We could write a strong-worded letter.
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Uh...
So much more than words...
I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
Alright.
Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
They didn���t know about the snowman story, and when I told ���em, they were not impressed.
Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I���ll hold. I���m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
OH MY GOD!
Edgy impressions.
0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
You never told me you were in high-school!
Thank you.
Express love, magical.
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
Did Donna tell you that?
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ���HARD ASS���] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
I promise you that I will.
You know, I don���t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog���s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..
I'm doing this for you Meredith!
Cause you���re always taking dumps.
A delicious moment.
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
Yeah, fine.
Duh. I know. That would be insane.
It���s just business.
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.
I don't do drugs!
Yes.
The temp at night?
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
8pm sharp.
No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line.  Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
I didn't know you had a brother.
Is everyone licensed?
You're welcome.
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.
I am going in there! Don���t���
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we���re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
That's very generous.
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
Rehash���
Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
[to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
I will fight you.
Better a cappella.
Are you factoring in the��� whole national ���economy���. declining and all that?
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
[with a sigh] Okay.
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
I didn't even say what it is.
Yeah, sure. What���s your question?
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
Oh, I see.
I���m going in there.
I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car]
I believe it means mouth pleaser.
We kinda nailed it.
Yeah, I guess.
They just didn���t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
No, got canned last week.
How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
Hello.
[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
[sighs]
Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
Woo!
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
Stupid dog.
Thirty minutes!
What? Sorry.
The bookstore?
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Well I'll do you one better.
So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
No.
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
Oh D.
Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!
Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
Yeah.
Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
Can you get the phone?
[swings] Dammit!
What's that, Stanley?
That is so mom.
That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ���action.���
Jackpot.
Rut ti doh doo doh
Mmhmmm.
Thank you.
People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ���You guys are killing it!��� I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
Water.
[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!
Hey.
Oh thanks.
Brava, brava.
We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
Then the basil will be fine.
I know that it���s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that���s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.
Yeah, yeah, it's great...
Hey.
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
I know who did this....Dwight.
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
Why does Erin like Gabe?
No !  [blows air horn and dances]
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Or both?
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
Don���t care. Tell me later.
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
Let me think about it--
Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
Australian accent...
Ha, that's why I wore this shirt.
Whoa!  What's the situation?
Nn no.
Okay.
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
Tuna... You're completely sane.
Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Fire guy [makes flames with his hands]
There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]
Aw!! Way better a cappella
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
Oh, I took out my lifts.
Yeah. All right!
And as such, I come to you...
Hey-OH!
It really looks great.  You did a great job.
I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
Nope! [stands up and leaves]
Charge!
It's like a haunted disco.
Thanks Dad���Darryl.
It's not... Whether or not, you...
Roller derby practice!
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll use my hands on it.
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
No. Not that I see here.
Yep.
It���s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
No that's... not how it works.
It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
What is all that?
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it���s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let���s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
Great. And Kevin.
Hm?
Fifty-two reams!
There���s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales���
Yeah.
That's a lie.
Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
It is? I'm sorry.
Phone's ringing.
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ���no��� not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I���m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
D-Bone. There you are.
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
You do?
Okay, it sounds risky.
AHHHHH!!!!!!!
Monsieur.
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
Hey!
Whoa. Okay.
Oh, baloney.
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
What happened in there?
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
This is gonna look so awesome!
[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
Well -
Why would people say that?
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
Four!  Three!  Two!  One!
What?
Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
can you believe this guy?
I don't want to talk about work right now.
That's it!
Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
Shane. Great game man!
Tom Brokaw!
Oh, really? From what, two to four?
What?
I have some good ideas...
She works here too, how is that any different?
Baby, don't hurt me.
Coolio.
It's the world's only international sport! [sits down]
Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
That's really nice, thank you.
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
I call foul, sir.
What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
He���ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
[baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.
If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Well, well, well, look who it is.
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause]
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
Are you okay?
Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
This is awesome!
What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
Yeah. Name another.
Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
Obviously I'm going to clean up.
���ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
OK what?
That you're sleeping with Dwight.
Those are fully staffed as well.
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
Do you like apples?
Yes.
Nice!
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
If-
Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don���t���it just��� I owe it to myself and my future fans.
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
I���m not going to take it. And then he���s going to be like ���whoa this is a really important meeting���.
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
Ah, come on!
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
OK, fine, yeah. that���s one guy���s opinion!
Sweet.
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
Uhh, beg your pardon?
Even the fact that I'm gay?
No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.
Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Well-
[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
Feel it against your cheek.
Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
And?
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
You know what? Go. Have fun.
What is it, Big Haircut?
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
..The camera don't lie!
It is not just coffee.
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.
What���s the mouse���s name?
Say it.
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
Surprise!
Bah���I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Kevin has that lovability.
Oh... [Kelly laughing]
It was like amateur hour.
Yeah. Right.
[punches button] Speakerphone!
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Well, I...
I'm pretty good at board games.
Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
He drives an SUV!
[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.
Whoa, fire!
[claps] That was fantastic.
Oh. Hmm.
It's my ear.
Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Took ���em one day.
Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Mobsters are!
Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
You're a hoarder. My god!
Count me in!
[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
[laughs] Totally!
That's the family boat!
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
I don't know how you got there.
I know, right?
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
That's not what I had in mind.
Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he���s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he���s hard to love, but did you know that he���s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
Okay! Hope you all learned something!
Fine.
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!
Yes!
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
Let's not go crazy.
Yeah, come on in. I���m just on hold with another talent agency. It���s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there���s more. 251. 252. I can���t even keep up!
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]
Let me think about it--
NO!  I want names!
I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.
Its��� I mean come on.
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
Okay, all right, all right, all right.
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
No what?
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
You guys...
Yeah, I know. Neiche!
Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?
Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
Big day for you.
Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
Very cool.
Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.
Oh, there's an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
Erin likes Gabe.
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
[opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.  We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.  Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.  Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider]  Yeees!  [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted.
It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
I was telling that... I was telling that.
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
Okay.
Banana cream is the first to go.  We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
Put the game on hold everyone.
I should make you my vichyssoise.
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
Yeah, I killed.
And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
Rude. And not helpful.
Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
Andrew Bernard.
What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
I said are you ready TO PARTY!
Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?
No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Okay.  Let's do it.
Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
No. It's over between you two.
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
All right!
[scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
What?!
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
Go, go, go, go!
Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
My parents are broke.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
[deep voice] Listen, I don���t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I���ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
I'll check the web.
[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
Done and done-er.
That is a penguin. You like it?
And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.
I���m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
What can't go on?
Death of a salesman.
Into the mic, sweetie.
It's not that, exactly.
Okay!
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
Awwhh, wow.
Oh! There we go! Pam?
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
White, because it contains all other colors.
No, it���s me, Andy!
Night.
Say-
Thank you, Erin.
No, I insist.
All right. I get it.
Thanks for coming in guys.
Yikes!
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
You didn���t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now���s your chance! I���m here. You got Qs; I got As.
Who else knows about it?
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Do you know why you never heard of it?
Why? Everybody's heard it.
Right, it feels strange.
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
Exactly.
Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Oh, cool.
Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]
[to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh���.oh boy.
It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
...So help us out.
Oh, man!
[doing eyewash] AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
I am so great!
[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.
Oh, just backing up and turning around.
Well that's not what we agreed on.
What���s the story?
Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
Right?
Not necessary.
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Uh-huh.
And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
Make it higher? Okay.
Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
Do you love him?
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
If I am not Boner Champ, I don���t know who I am.
Good morning, Pam.
[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.
Ooh, she's counting again.
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
That's not you.
Thank you. [leaves]
[grunts] Augh.
We need you, OK?
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
And this is where I will record your sales.
Are you sure?
[chuckling] Okay.
One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]
Let me know what they say.
Jim?
Thank you. [hangs up]
And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
That's actually 'Master of Ceremonies' Bernard.
I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis' iPod]
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
Of course.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
[British accent] No.
[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
Yeah.
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
Done.
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
She���s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
[taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.
I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
Yeah.
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Yeah?
Dijonnaise.
Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.
Whoa.
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
Dude, that is my face!
Neither am I, it���s already done.  Hah, I���m just kidding, it���s going to take some time.
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
See you later.
Maybe we could switch instruments.
A little frazzled.
My bare hands.
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
Yeah, right?
Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
There was a fire in the warehouse?
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here?
[Group continues chanting ���Fail!���]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants]
Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute 'break a legs' or 'I still love you' type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
Let's go to the conference room.
No, I'm good.
Now?
Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
My whole life is a booger bubble!
Yeah, uh, excuse me.
Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
Nice.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now��� [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
You give up?
Congratulations.
Can I introduce you around now?
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
Is that what that is?
Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
This is great.
I guess it's starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
[on computer screen] Ah, what else? I���ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
[making pencil imprint] Dammit.
Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
I had no idea.
I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
I have a delicious secret.
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
I don't have any ideas though.
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
which I will not be a part of-
We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
Congratulations to you.
Hey! Tuna! He's back.
Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
I do.
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Bring it on guys.
I didn't.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
I know.
Right?
Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
What?
I can do a better one.
You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
No thanks.
No! [runs off]
Bump! I bumped it!
Very very smart.
--sorry, you go.
Hey, yes.
No way!?
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
Thank you.
Hey, boss man.
C���mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I���m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine]
Gotta get my goin' out on.
[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
Here for what?
Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I���m thinking of. Can you clarify that?
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
Uh, this has got to stop.
Well, that...really bums me out.
Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.
Yeah?
Not helping, tuna.
On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
You're not?
��� yeah���
Right?
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
Whoa! Mind blown. It���s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
That brilliant little bitch.
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Yes like a chime or a bell...
Dang it.
Nonsense. Get up here.
[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down.
Dwight why don���t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
Sure? Okay.
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
Well, okay then.
You humiliated me in front of every body!
All right!
I'm glad you asked ��� Connecticut Casual.
Definition.
Take care Julia.
No, I-
That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
This conversation is over.
Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
[singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
Great game, coach.
Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
[softly] What a coincidence.
[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
[throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
Who was Cornell's eighth president?
What?
A madhouse.
It's the new guy. [looks at Jim]
[laughing] I like tea!
This is Andy Bernard!
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing]
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.
You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good.
...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
So you had a bad day...
Uh, that's not what was-
Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
You have his email?
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
Absolutely.
[drumroll with hands] I��� it���s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice���s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ���I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.��� Smart, right?
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
Tuna!
Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
Oooooo, saucy.
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
Whoa!
Sorry.
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
No.
Why is the truck empty?
I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
It's got pheromones in it.
Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
Of the hourglass..
You're choking him!
After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.
Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]
So.
No, it's in New Mexico.
I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
Let's go, let's go.
Yeah. [clapping]
Did the email go out or���
Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
I don't care.
Oh D!
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
You guys came.  Where���s everyone else?
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
You got it.
No, best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, and I care why?
Oh.
That's awesome.
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
That's not different enough.
Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
Fascinating.
I wish you well on your quest.
Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.
Maybe like a year ago...
This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.
I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
At least until Stanley calms down.
I changed my mind. [gives Nelly papers]
Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation���s Lisa Loeb.
Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
Yeah.
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'
So... here's the thing about infidelity.
Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
Even without an audience you���re still at it.
Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
But off the record, I'm kinda confused.
Anything.
Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
Carla Fern is not just an actor���s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
Close it.
There he is!
It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
Just, please...
Erin.
It's like a ten minute walk.
Mm.
Hey!
Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
Ow.
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
I gotta go talk to her.
Isn't that your money?
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
Michael... am I gay?
Nice sweater.
Awesome.
Hang on.
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
Hello.
[knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
Up high.
You do have a fantastic basement.
Hello Kitty's for girls.
Reverse snobbery.
Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
Hi.
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
Who?
Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
Let's do it.
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
I got it, try, um--[Coughs]
Yeah.
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
My Cornell a capella group.
Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
How'd it look?
We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
Me too. Hold my place in line.
Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
Yeah.
OF course not.  There���s no magic button.  You have to summon that.
Well-
[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
[to Clark] So this is a single.
Yo.
I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
B-9.
What do I see in Angela?
Can you go over those options again?
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
Stock market.
Have you lost weight?
Right-o.
[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
That is just obnoxious.
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
In a minute. In a minute.
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
Pretty Woman.
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
I play the banjo.
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
I will try.
That's so beautiful.
Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.
What do you mean?
Ah, OK.
I just need you to know-
Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
You're asking him to give up all of his power.
You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
We're done Meredith.
[makes frustrated noises]
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women���s soccer, no?
Did you maybe tell them that or...?
No, this is horrifying.
That is what I'm showing you.
Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
Yes! The dude is an enigma.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
Five to six hours?
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell]
[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
You were?
Angela!
Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
You can't. You can't.
Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.
Kevin, you open it up.
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
See what I mean?
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
He does your laundry?
I don���t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
[raised eyebrows] Okay.
Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords!
[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
One, two, three, go!
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Because we could get some food...
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
Really?
Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
You don���t like the hats?
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
Yeah?
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it���s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
I don't care either way, so....shut up.
Oscar, it's not that hot out.
Stop saying my name.
Who'd you get?
Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
No.
Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.
No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
We're taking a picture.
Class is canceled, everybody out!
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
Aaah! [everyone clapping] So good!
Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
I don't care, that's how much I swear!
I was too embarrassed! [group laughs]
Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
Lot going on guys. What���s happening?
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
Right? Rough scene.
I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
Welcome back Tuna!
Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
Oh, God.
You're running from the problem.
They are already off, my good sir.
I mean... [Pam giggles]
Mm-hmm.
No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'
Can you do it?
That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]
[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
I didn't see that movie.
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
I'm Andy.
That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
You up for a chest bump?
I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be���[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ���Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes��� by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith���African American���Mambazo.
Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
Hey, boss.
It sure seems like he is lying.
No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se��or Loadenstein.
Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]
Oh! Seven new comments. ���The guy at 0:19 is hawt!��� [typing] ���Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!���[reading] ���He's not hawt, he's gay.��� [typing] ���Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.��� [reading] ���He is hawt!��� See, thank you, that's more like it. ���He is butt.��� God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
Hey, look at that. Done.
Hey, how are you?
It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
That's not how that goes.
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]
Hi.
Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
Pizza rolls.
Get back to normalcy.
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
Yes.
Enngh-
Oh.
Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]
Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That���s something you can���t take back.
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
I thought you were in rehab.
Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
No way!
Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...
So make that error!
Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?
You're not making any sense.
What do you mean, take my job?
None of your business.
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
Cool!
Mm.
I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
How do you not have a toothbrush?
I'm gonna lose 'em.
But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!
That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
[hugs Darryl] I���m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
Hi.
Hey, Mrs. California.
I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug.
Some people are really popping on screen!
Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Yes! I���m sorry I���m being curt, it���s just I���m about to land a top talent agent.
Sorry, when did you get married?
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
I knew it!
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
Everyone please, just-
That���s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.
Mmm-hmm. Erin?
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Have a good meeting!
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Hmm.
Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.
Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
Okay.
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
Yeah.
[coughs sentence] Nice comeback!
She's like, probably a tutor.
Are you volunteering?
Bro, I do that all the time.
[confused] Yeah.
So pretty today.
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.
[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
I'm like a quarter of the way through.
You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
[on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
Ruh duh duh da dudes! What���s up?
The answer is yes.
Yes I can.
Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
Stanley, you're suppose to close.
Mmm, I doubt that very much.
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
I stole it!
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
Dwight has defeated the computer.
I can���t.
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
Oh, we got this!
Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
Did she have any last words or?
You'll thank me when they spank thee.
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven't had a very hard life.
You said your upper back itched.
There���s a mole?
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
Dwight?
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
Nnnnya.
And your affiliation with Cornell -
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
No.
Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
Thank you.
Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Well... there's no instructions.
I'm punishing them.
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
You are murdering the Nard-dog!
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
Oscar
Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
What?
What can I do for ya Hoss?
Okay. Robert���s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
Then I will write it down.
Ok.
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
What happened to old salty?
Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
Thornwood Wholesalers.
She probably a t--
Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
Guess what? Not happening at work.
Umm... I'm number three.
How's it going over here, guys?
Just don���t do the song anymore.
[gets up] I'll do it.
I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
Well played.
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
Hey, Danny.
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
Hey-o!
You know Darryl?
Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
Well, I think down���s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
I, I thought that you would like it.
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
Pffft.
Alright, I've scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
Who's this guy?
Ooh I didn���t mean to offend you, and I hope you���ll forgive me because I am very very��� Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Baseball! Go talk to him.
No. I���m a rogue.
Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.'
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Oh, come on!
Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.
[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.
Do you have a specific place in mind?
[with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
Jamie!
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
Women friends?
Excuse me?
How could I not have realized?
[claps] Chef from South Park, it's genius!
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
Time's up!
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Move it!
Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
I give thanks, mon.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Okay.
I'll go with you Stanley.
Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows]
We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
[Angela kisses him] Hey-oh!
Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!
Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
Nah. I like my plan better.
Take. That down.
Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.
It-- it's warm.
What was that?
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
Consider it nailed.
We promised we���d never say goodbye.
You can't dock my pay-
Is it true?
Ooh. It's coming down out there.
Wow.
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
We will start here at Erinville.
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Wait, wait.
Guys! Guys! Guys!
Golf.
What are you still doing not at your desk?
Whose your favorite iron chef?
[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
Guys?
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
Really?  That doesn't sound right.
Well, but it-
No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.
[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
[inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour!
Yes.
No I���m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn���t, I���m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don���t like to throw around the b-word, but I���m going to be a huge bitch to you.
Agh! Son of a bitch!
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
Hmm.
You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
Yea?
Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]
Yeah.
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
[removes teeth] Creed's going?!
Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
That's clever, Debutante.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
I think I should go the hospital.
Damn it.
No, no, no. I���m wearing makeup.
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
Thanks.
Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight]
Ow! Get off! Get off!
Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe��� you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
Do you think that they've ever...
Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
You're welcome.
No.
For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
Sure.
Thank you. Not gonna need it.
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you���re amazing, okay? You���re obviously gonna be on the show, so it���s someone else���s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I���m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Hey!
Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who���s next? Darryl?
Hey, Kev.
Of course!
You sure?
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
I���ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm���.
Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
Thanks, Angela. You too.
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
I'm acting my heart out here.
[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
I think we should.
Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
That really works.
Close it.
Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.
Why? Is it employee���s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
Oh, thank you.
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
Yeah.
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
Yeah, its where they make stuff.
[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
What's up? I got your e-mail.
Good-bye, Lackawana County.
Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
I... don't know. Help me.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Crystal.
We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
Why would that make me a pervert, I -
Yeah.
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
I wasn���t fired. What are you talking about? I���m fired up, yes. Guys, I���m���I���m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
Football cream. Grr!
I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn���t help.
Where?
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
No, I'm just testing if he can hear.
Yes!
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.
Why don���t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Not at all.
What's bad?
Did he tell you how I got the name?
Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
No.
Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who?
Gahhh. That's five strikes.
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Where's the concierge?
Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]
Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.
[Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
You my friend are in a very close second.
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
For two hours? Really?
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
Come on pam!
That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Um, nerthing?
Got it. Then I will call you.
I���m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it���s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
: Yes. And yes. [chuckles]
Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]
What?
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?
So, it's a date.
For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
You never update it.
Okay, sorry.
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Love you too.
Yes, it's Eddie.
Is that right?
No, that���s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about���
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I���
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
Yeah, but here���s the thing. I can���t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I���ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Never cry wolf.
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
[through the car window] Kick Wallace's ass!
Time!
I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
When what? [clears throat] When what?
Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
You got it.
What are you doing here?
It was?
Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
No.
You were saying you chose me���. There was a reason?
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?
Great!
The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
OK great.
Erin go braugh!
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
I���m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Yeah���um, how is everything?
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
That's low, Tuna.
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
Thank you. Yeah,
Not a question.
I think he can hear us.
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
Yes!
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar]
[going for it] Alright.
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Totally.
Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
What?!
Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
Mmm. [takes one and eats it]
Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
I'm sorry, nine days until what?
Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
No I didn���t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it���s weird that she���s not calling.
Yes!
Oh yeah.
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
Give me something!
Who are your role models?
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
I don't care, so it doesn't matter.
Damn it!
Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Make a donation.
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
I���ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]
Twenty points.
A minute would be cool.
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
Oh no.
Feel ya, dawg.
She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Swear to God, hope to die. Now let���s get to work!
You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
Yeah, right?
I didn't know you were going to be here.
Closet full of mes-
Umm, on the contrary.
[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in]
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
[buzzer noise] We were looking for 'kitten.'
Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
Can we talk about this in private?
It's on!
Do you like it?
Sha-bow.
Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
Yeah, Dwight.
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
What?
I can't tell if he's mocking me.
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.
Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
I found my calling.
Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
Trying to get a head count.
Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Hey Kevin, what are you doing?
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
That's completely backwards.
Clean the toilets.
Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
Do it.
She's taking us back to first base.
They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don���t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
Do you know anything about physics?
I am not asking, I am ordering.
Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
Hour forty-five.
I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
Yeah.
I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
Hey! Where did you go?
This branch, I'm the regional manager.
Why would anyone frame you for that?
I was...
All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby���s thighs]
Okay, TMI.
I know, right?
Maybe we have a plan for you?
Super romantic.
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.
That was awful.  Robert I apologize.
So how do you want, how should I do it?
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
Erin!
I���m delivering it from the fridge. It���s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
I heard it from Erin.
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.
It was hilarious.
Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]
I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
Noishe.'
Thank you.
Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
I know it's like cricket.
What if you���re being attacked by a ��� smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it���s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
Carla! Carla!
Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
Angela, you like lacrosse?
Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
Oh, no.
People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
I'm so jealous right now.
Sixty bucks a session.
���.Stanley..
I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
Just make him stop the freaking bus!
Okay.
Mushroom caps.
This is your���you brought this on.
No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Okay.
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
Pause after 'news'.
Good!
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
Why not, dawg?
Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
Oh boy. [follows Oscar back to coach]
We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
Oh, whew!
Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.
Yeah?
Not guy friends?
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
What are you gonna do with all this time?
Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
I forgot, a��� a pan, uh ���
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
You guys ready to party?
Where?
Ehh.
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
Aw, that���s cute.
Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
What about a cat eating man food?
Are you sure?
-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael���s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I���m so not prepared.
I have needs.
Good, good. What else?
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.
I don't know. [chuckles]
Afterwards at the...
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
[passes out hats] One for you.
Which is insanely painful.
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look]
Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?
Aww.
No.
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...
A baby what? A human?!
Mmmm.. suck-ah!
I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
No.
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor���.vanilla?
I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it.
Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
Yeah, but��� My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It���s going to be terrible.
Ho hah!....oh, shoot.
Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
Andy. What���s yours?
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.
Seems like...
Really?
That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It���s like a festival of poo.
Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
I am dying of lovesickness and horny-sickness.
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
Rut tit doh doh...
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
Because you suck.
Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]
Baby, don't hurt me!
You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
Cindy, Cindy.
Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!
Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.
Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
Night.
Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
This is for pleasure.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
[to Susan] Cameras...
Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Walk around apple orchards.
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...
Yeah.
Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
Oh! [laughter]
I would agree with that.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
I'm not asking for one, I need it.
Why would you say that?
I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you���re Boner Champ.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
Mm-hmm.
When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ���You can't be a skipper until you're a man.��� You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
No! No! No!
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
Exactly. Help me po��� mouth, Darryl.
It's junk!
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
Ok. [signs paper] thanks.
Let me get a picture of you guys.
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
Yeah.
These cookies are fine.
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
Yeah?
That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
Angela?
I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
You go first.
Woo!
Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
I don't think so.
Who says that?
You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
The one in the green hoodie.
Is this Robert���s attempt to embarrass me?
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.
That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
Which one did you see?
Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...
Yeah, sell.
Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
That's insane!
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
Wow. From janitor to manager?
Excuse me.
No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Seriously, you guys, ask me.
Sure.
Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]
Hey-o!
Wet Tuna!
Great! [sits down]
What are you gonna play mange on faster?
See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It���s Clark and, um���
I wasn't acc-, accusing...
Hundred and twenty points.
Darryl said, ���Cool, man.��� He called me as cool man.
Oh...
Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
I'm her fiance.
Light side.
What's up, gangstas?
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
Stop the bus!
So no?
Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
All right. Formative years. [She laughs]
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
How could I not see it?  You're so right.
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
Awkward.
Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
[at same time as Kevin] I did it.
Clutch cream run, bro.
My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
[weak] Hi Tuna.
[nodding towards Michael] The Huntsman.
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs]
Of course. I own my toothbrush.
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
Hey. What's up?
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
Who else?
How does that work?
Kevin, I appreciate what you���re trying to do.
Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Saying I love... Saying I love you...
Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
Jim.
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
No.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...
What?
What?
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
And where did you go?
Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can.
Isn't that part of the fun?
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Thanks T-Dog.
Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
Phyllis!
We called Angela?
Do the next one.
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Mmmhmm. [leaves]
[fanfare]
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
You didn���t let me finish. That���s not fair.
Go away, we're running lines.
David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
What are you going to see?
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
The fire's shooting at us!
[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
Hi gam-gam.
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
You bet.
Yep. This is Erin.
I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I���m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
Yeah!
250
What?
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
What do you got?
Really?
How?
Alright! Here we go.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
No way, lady.
Oh my God!
-ket
Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
Look, it's not that I don't want-
So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
Dude, you struck out.  They're totally stuck up.  Here... drink up.
Who is it?
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
WB!
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
Oh, its on.
Fart���.. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg���s asleep.
After you.
I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'
Here...
OK.
All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -
No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
Correction.  It was my idea.
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
Where did you get this?!
It doesn���t include headshots.
Surprise! [laughs]  It's from everybody.  $15 value.
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
We're done. Erin and I are over.
My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
Hmm?
It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ���move on���. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]
Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
I wasn't telling you.
Duh.
I don't know.
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
No I'm just sweating.
I know, right?
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
It just was one of those things-
Was the top salesman...
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
Huh?
Oooohhh.
Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Doesn���t mean you���re the best singer ever. Dick.
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
OK?
I'm still the boss!
Heyyy��� let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Now this is called slack lining.
Safe travels.
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Me too.
Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
It's so good to meet you!
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
Just close it.
It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
[song ends] Toby, how did we do?
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
Yeah. We are thrilled.
Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
Perfect.
I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
You know, the marmalade sounds great.
Thank you.
[to Michael's camera] Hardcore Parkour!
Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that.
Ah... busted. Yes
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
Ha! Knew it!
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
What���s up, guys? Just thought we���d have a little rap session, talk about business���see how things are going? Ahem���
Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus' Party in the USA]
Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.
And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
Right-o.
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
[Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon'
What���re you still doing here?
Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.
Get out of my way, Jim!
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
[singing] You know I can, my man.
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
He beat the computer.
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man���s signature solo is his for life, okay? That���s group policy and you know it.
Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
Dwight...
We're one in a million.
[waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks!
Hi.
With fury...
Yes.
How many dates have you been on?
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
You would?
Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
Seriously?' Are you serious?
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
I mean, it's pretty broken already.
Hmm?
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
Yo. Dudeces.
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out ���you suck my nutz��� from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
Hey, fellas!  And... lady.
Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
Yeah!
And I'm a director.
Yeah, me, too.
And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
Dwight!
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert���man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how���s the sales doubling ���project going?
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
How next to?
Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
Later man.
[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]
Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.
Yes.
Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
Hi guys.
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
That is not okay dude.
Yeah.
Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
[sings] What is love?
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
Darryl, what do I do?
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Yeah, I know.
Hey there. It���s a pleasure.
Ooh, that sounds great.
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area]
[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ���95. Hey there, um, I���m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here���De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale���uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I���m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Welcome.
Goat���
Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
Hey Michael...
Yeah, how do you play?
I can't hear you through the glass
[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]
Mm, well, you used to be.
Is it fresh? [winks]
Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Pull the poop out of the toilets.
Sure.
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
Thought about it, I'm in.
Class act. Boy scout.
Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
I said no hits!
What's the occasion?
No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
I use the word ���guys��� a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
All righty.
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
Rut ti doh doh...
Sure, I um..I didn't know.
Okey dokey. [knocks on door]
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.
Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
You didn't have to do that.
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn���t.  [to Robert] I���m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
No.
Yes, yes, yes!
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
I���m sorry ��� I���m with a very important client. It���ll have to wait.
Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.
Ribbit!
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I���m gonna thank people.
Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.
K
Sorry?
Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.
I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ���Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas��� Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.
I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
She's nature's bounty.
Alright everybody, you are doing great!
And you're fired...
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
What?
Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
You look awesome.
I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
Alright.
No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
What?!
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
From 'Cheers'.
Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
[wipes nose] Sorry.
If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
Good morning.
What's up, man?
She's babysitting?
Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
We couldn���t crack it.
Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk]
Yeah. No. Well, ok.
If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you���ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
Well that's not--
Ha. The other guys can go die.
[in robot voice] What is going on?
[silently mouths] Wow!
I am calm.
Dwight.
Yeah, it is actually.
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering]
Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
I... Got... It.
Fine!
My first order of business: accept.
Are you kidding?
You have to.
Website check please.
Well I don't see that happening.
I���ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?
Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-
So?
What do you think?
Is somebody there?
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
That's a good one.
[in character] Hey there young lady.
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
You wanna go?
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
A little warm.
No, that's ridiculous.
[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
I���m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it���s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
Will end completely!
No. Because they all left.
Re-suture.  Sutures, yes.
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
No.
[interrupting contestant singing ���Beautiful��� by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You���re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You���re like, my three favorite people ever.
Whoa! What is crackin?
I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.
You think I can do better?
Why? Why? [looks at Jim]
That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
My new girlfriend.
Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
It���s only 6:00. Come on, everybody���s going.
[laughs]
then I'll take a table!
Didn't see that coming.
Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
Well it's the thought that counts.
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor]
Oh, my gosh.
Then I'll get something too.
Well now hold on it, it-
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Not this time.
That's a racing stripe.
Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
This is kinda time sensitive.
I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
Hey... David Wallace!
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
What?
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
That's as hard as I can hint.
I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I���m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I���m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they���re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you���re in the good old days before you���ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
You mean a moon bounce.
What? Based on what?
It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you.
Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
I swear...
Let's just jump in the air!
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
Are you...
Morning, everyone.
No.
I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion���
Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
Oh my god.
Darryl is a jerk.
...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Well, that went pretty well.
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin']
Seriously?
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
Yeeeeah.
Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.
And those sand grains are tumbling..
What?
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
Alright, a plan it is.
Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.
What is wrong with her?
I cannot believe you're still up!
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
What do you think of Angela?
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.
Already? This, this guy is persistent!
No.
Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound]
You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
Of course there are!
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!
Where's Dwight?
Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
You know your soccer, man.
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I���m all for it.
What happened? What can I do to help?
By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
Thirty-one.
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
[fist pound each other] Totally.
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.
Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Whoa.
Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I���m going to refuse to take it.
Bye guys.
Uh...
Yes.
I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
Yes, I do. Phyllis.
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
No!
[on the computer] You���re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
Yeah.
I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ���.Confession: I don���t know what I���m doing.
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
Hey Kevin.
Sounds controversial.
Oh! Ah, Megan.
Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
Nope. I have made up my mind. I���m really sorry.
Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
[relieved] Yes!
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
What??
Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs]
I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
I guess this is my life now.
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
Yeah, I do. I have that.
I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar���s friend walks up] Not anything.
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
Ugh.
Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
Just, you sure Clark?
You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
Okay.
Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
No.
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael]
[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
Okay, thanks.
You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
Yeah.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
Think we'll find him?
All right.
Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
I mean, it's distant, but...
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
But I just���it���s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn���t���
Alright fine.  You know what ��� I guess this place just hasn���t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I���m still going.  And I���m not going to ask anymore.  I���m not even going to look back.  I���m just going to assume that you���re with me.
Really?
Dr--- You can call me Drew.
[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
Will do, boss-man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
What's going on?
Who knows?
Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.
No.
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
Hey, Erin.
What?
Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
Um, cheeseburger.
How romantic is this?
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...
We have to clean this up now!
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
...my girlfriend's back!
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
Tonight.
You wanted to see me?
Are we scaring them straight....?
Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
I think you're going to like it.
Wahhh...
[laughing at something on his computer]
OK, keep in mind, it���s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points���.or best offer.
As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
Sure thing, buddy.
Hmm. Very true.
No.
You got a minute?
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
[eyewashes again] AHH! AHH! AHH!
Divorced?
No... I didn't steal your joke.
Closing time
Yes, I do.
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
[in falsetto] Please Mr. President-
No where near the big rock.
Don���t touch me.
Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]
Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
Dwight we got five strikes.
That���s a crazy amount of points.
Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
Yeah, but I'm number three.
Okay.
One. Two. Three. Shot!
So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.
Ah, OK.
That...
Aww, I mean...
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
Val, I need the space.
My maid died.
I love to dance-
Hey boss. Got a minute?
Ok.  Erin I think you know I���ve been dating someone.
I know, I know that you're proud of me.
[falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.
Up to you.
Should I change?
Oh-oh, come on!
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Awesome. [to Pete] Plop!
Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.
Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?
It's literally like-
[struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I���d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Well I have the, the blue book value...
You guys, they're making out.
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
You have your team.
Gosh, I hope so.
Alright.
We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.
Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]
No, we were really making out in the woods.
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
[looking at Angela's costume] Approved!
It doesn't matter.
My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
Hey, bud.
Yeah.
...Ryan...
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
Ah... [stammers]
Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?
OK!
What?
Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.
Ugh, oh god!
All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
These are delicious.
You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]
No no no no.
No, I did not.  Was that any good?
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
Drew.  I'm Drew now.
Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
Hey, any fun weekend plans?
Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
Thank you.
Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
Yeah, some of that existed before.
Okay, guys!
Alright, you got it.
[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?
Ah! That���s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
But who
Mmmm...
This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Yeah.
They don't know how.
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
���..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
T-bag bone���
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
Do me! Do me!
Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
Yes bosses.
Okay.
No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]
Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
This dance competition is not over.
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
Specific shout-out..
[over phone] I am so horny.
Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
How long has it been going on?
Everyone.
Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
This is what I was trying to tell you.
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
I���m sorry, what?
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
I'm...  I'm asking you out.
Me likey!
Eleanor Roosevelt once said ���the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.��� [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she���s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I���m doing the right thing.
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]
Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
It has my face on it.
[cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!
No, that's...
[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.
Yeah.
[singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
It's John Gotti, you idiot!
[loudly] Harry and the Henderson's
You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Seriously?
Yeah, it was. That���s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ���Banjo at 0:19 is aight��� Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
No drama. Ok.
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
No, this is my time! You don���t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
So like, missionary...
Thank you. That feels good.
Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
Whoa!
Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
My name is Andy!
No kidding?
Thank you.
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
Are you playing for the other team?!
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
Thinking--
No. I don't.
What does this say?
So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
No time to chat.
Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
Oh.
Of Flatt & Scruggs!
Maybe. Only maybe.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
Jim?
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
Thank you!
I had no idea.
[chuckles] Addition by subtraction.
Guys..
Well...
Just need a second outside.
So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]
At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
Hey Darryl.
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
No way!
Yeah, what day?  What day?
Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it���ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-
Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
Thanks, Kevin.
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
I'm sorry, I meant later.
I'm in it to win.
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
[coughs word] Idiot!
Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
That was fun last night.
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
What?
Twenty seconds to go time.
Sure.  I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.
That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
Well, you got it this year too.
I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
There what is?
[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say 'aye']
Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
Well, hello.
It's over.
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
What?
Yes! Thank you! Such as?
Well, so what?  Your body's a ten.
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
This is your big day. Come on.
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Ooh, gosh!
Please!
Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves��� [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Surprise! Your new crew.
Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
Yes.
Do you guys like apples?
Cici is Jim's daughter.
What do you got?
So we're just, like, jamming as friends?
This guy looks like a real deviant.
Yeah.
That's not why I came over.  I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi.
Did you check your... butt?
Yeah, ok.
I left my cell phone in my car.
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
We'll use code names.
Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
Hey, Jim.
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
I am gay, and I prefer men.
I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I���m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog���had to pull rank.
I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
What is wrong with you?
You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Good.  Drew.
We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
What are we gonna do about this?
Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
Whoa--
What are you guys talking about?
Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
Yes, a madhouse.
Ok, fine.
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
There���s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
Wha...?
Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
And it���s getting a little more serious.  She���s never come by.
Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey...
Get excited!
Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?
This has been a really tough time.
Tuna dog!
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
Boo-yea! [office laughs]
I'm saying no.
Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
Pi...
[to Dwight] Where you going?
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
What do you think?
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
Who is the gal in question?
What?
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
Get out of the way!
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Wait. Seriously?
Yes I will.
Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
Uh, I'll hear the other one.
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
I don���t know where it came from.
Like your toothbrush and stuff.
[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Well are you?
Did you mean a real date?
Cool.
Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
We will be team U.S.A.
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
Oh.
So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
Great.
I���m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Really?
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Great!
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away]
Don���t���don���t���
Oh, cool.
[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.
Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
Ohh...
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
I got you health insurance.
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]
Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
On it!
It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
I have to pick one of those?
Midnight what?
No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
How does he feel about it?
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.
My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.
I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
I believe in that.
Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
[dances] Whoo! Yeah!
Hey-oh!
Hobos live in trains.
Then I'll make you.
[speechless]
Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you���re talking about?
That's how it works!
No. It���s a job. Things are going great.
Naked.
A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
What's up?
Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
I got mine. They were really good.
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dwight's grandfather was a���[is interrupted by Dwight].
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
Well, ah, ah...
Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
And you sold it to Jan too.
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Are you insane? It���s the Cornell fight song.
All good, Santa.
Wow, that's wonderful!
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Oh, doggie.
I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
My nanny used to wear that.
Yeah...
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
I'm taking it over from here.
Your wish is my command.
Dah!  Come on!
[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs]
I don't normally do this, but...
From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
Yeah.
Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don���t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I���m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
Oscar says ���hi��� all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ���Hi��� ���Hello��� ���Hola��� You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ���hi���?
I wanna take you to sex school.
Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
Yeah. It's pretty close.
No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
Einsteins! Great work.
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
What?
Excuse me.
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ���er rip. What do you hate about this place?
Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
[snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Well, what do you want?
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
Come on, just do it.
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.
Try and keep me from coming!
Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?
I'm willing to pay you.
Angela Bernard.
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
A year.
I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
The cost of doing business.
I didn���t do anything any of you wouldn���t have done.
Andy, or Andrew.
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Kay.
Let us know if you need anything.
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
Michael, you're up.
[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...
Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
As in...
Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Steven Sondheim.
Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?
Go Einsteins!
Count to twen - count to twenty.
Yeah, absolutely!
[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
You guys...
He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo���hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing��� no traditions!
Um Phyllis, who's that?
[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
Is it true?
What the heck was that?
Yes! Yes.
Oh, he's out there.
No.
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Nope.
[applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.
Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
No.  No that was real.
Thanks, Oscar.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day.
Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Yes!
Come on, get over here.
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
They sure do.
I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
Hey, we'll be just fine.
Oh, my God!
Bueno.
Yeah, if I had my own--
Yeah! Yeah.
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
Um, what are we talking price wise?
