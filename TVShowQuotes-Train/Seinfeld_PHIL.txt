But, I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key.
Well, that's the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry) How's he doing?
You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong.
No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door)
Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.
(from inside the apartment) Yeah, I'm here. (comes to the door. The caged parrot is visible in the background)
Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.
(dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants.
(walking up to get inside after George) Thanks.
Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food.
Well this has been one hell of a night.
(sulkily) Yeah. (Jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut)
