Baka! Kora wa sugoi cheating desu!Â 

The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!

Pull up next to them. The fight is on!

I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! 

Are we badasses?

Fire. 

Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!

Well no, that'd be illegal.

Alright what the hell is going on here?!

All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.

All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?

God damn it.

Fire at will! 

We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-

Are we ready to do this?

All right, kid! End of the line!

Hohhh, they got them.

Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.

You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! 

Full sail, Your Majesty?

Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. 

Go inside! Move! 

You people just don't give up, do ya?

Survival of what?

Are we badasses?

Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?

This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!

You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.

Oh my God.

Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.

Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?

Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. 

Why not?

All right men, come on. We're going in.

Got who?

We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
