Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.
This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!
I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! 
Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. 
Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. 
You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-
We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.
All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?
Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! 
Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?
That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Looks like they're whaling now. 
All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?
Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
All right men, come on. We're going in.
You people just don't give up, do ya?
