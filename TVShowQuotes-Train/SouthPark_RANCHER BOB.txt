Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back.
Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.
I followed a calf-curling path right to your house, ma'am.
Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.
Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?
And in here, boys and girls, we have our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal.
Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. 
You see, in the six days since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.
Well, if we called it "little baby cow" people might not eat it.
Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death.
