Salad.
Got it.
Hey.
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
A bazooka. You remembered.
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
I do not look worried.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
I hate her too.
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
No, try me.
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
An ���X.���
Dammit! [hangs up]
In juvie.
I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Have a seat.
He's heading downtown.
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
[chokes up]
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
No, you will be tested.
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
I am not bluffing!
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Got it?
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
Just the one window?
Oh, man, am I a woman?
Please take an agenda item.
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Bring him the gabba-gool!
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
Our theme, if you will.
Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Uh, Oh.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
OK.
Oh, tips are expected?
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
You!
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
He is.
No, you can stop.
oh���
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
He'll die.
Aye.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Uh, 24. 37.
I'm sorry it makes me nervous.
So what do you need me to do?
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
That's Andy Bernard.
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Like an AIDS test?
[to Nellie] I told you.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
Hey!
Knight Rider.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Waste of a good hatchet.
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
Mm-hmm.
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
I have absolutely no idea.
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
Do you want to do this right or not?
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
By any means necessary?
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Michael-
Family only.
Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
Yeah.
K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight���s desk]
Quiet, you.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
No, no. Give me the steam.
In your face!
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Okay, how's that?
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
I was just showing her my belt.
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
What is this?
Jim won't sign my expense report.
Did you do her?
Wow.
There he is.
Do you have your money belt?
[applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Hey buddy, what are you up to?
More of a, barbaric growl.
How do you know that?
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
Oh. Terrible idea.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
From when he recommended me to replace him.
Yes! As your representative?
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Good.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
Well... it's my own fault.
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
Not my style.
Kung-fu movies!
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
Oh no, it's broken.
It's not fair.
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
You did.
That is not true.
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Let's go.
Jonas.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
D-W-I-G-H-T.
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
Office Depot!
Okay. So yeah.
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
What about Shoe La La?
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Ok, tell him that's not true.
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Don't want it.
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
Oh man,
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Really?
The waitress tripped on the cord.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
So you'll be reporting to me, then.
Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.
Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
Ugh.
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
They're testing it now.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
Hurl your feces.
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
Which is you' is not a sentence.
No no no.
No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively]
That's on a need-to-know basis.
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
Okay.
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
The planet Caprica.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
No, I insist.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Get lost.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
KGB.
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Check it out.
Come on. I'll drive.
They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
Yes.
What did you---
Phyllis.
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
Just act natural. [grunts]
Come down right away!
Yeah!
I asked you a question.
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Karen Filippelli.
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
Hey Pam.
You're the stupid one.
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
Oh, dear God in heaven.
Meat grinder.
What? Something happened?
[impatient sigh]
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
All right!
Get in the van.
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Who was the second man on the moon?
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Damn it!
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
You came into my office voluntarily.
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Gah!
I'll ask you a question.
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
No! No!
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
Dwike?
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
Let me out or you're fired.
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
They are unrelated.
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
Yes.
Oh, no!
Yes.
Vietnam sounds.
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
No women or children. Unless provoked.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Interviewer has suspect motives.'
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
No doy!
I think it did.
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Oh, man. White people, right?
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
Hey.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
And your veil.
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
That would be nice wouldn't it?
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
No.
Like who?  Who doesn't know?
Kevin Costner.
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Mose, bags! Now!
That's a very good record.
[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
No.
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
Okay.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Don't lose your head.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
I'm gonna say 30.
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
Hey shut up.  You're dead.
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
That's an exaggeration.
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
Good.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
You don't work here! You're not Jim!
No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
Yeah!
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
The eyes are the groin of the head.
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
Angry.
Cut.
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
Before taxes.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
I throat-rip.
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
[lets go] Good morning.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
He's not kidding.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
What does it say?
Okay, who moved my desk?
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
Packer.
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
Whassup.
Mmm-hmm.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
Where? Dark side or light side?
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
Go put them all in random order.
They match the carpet
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
We could do it in the warehouse.
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Oh my God.
Right now!
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
I can tell. I won't let you down.
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Who are you?
Yeah.
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
Just for fun?
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
I've said too much.
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
I'll do--
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
It's small, I know.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
I have to do something to his eyes.
What?
Do the monkey face!
Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
Oh my god.
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
Jan Levinson-Gould.
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
Okay.
Shunning resumed.
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
[walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.
So am I.
[quietly] Phyllis?
It's uh, it's in beta testing.
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Oh, man, am I a woman?
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
I���m trying to make him feel important.
Blood, urine, or semen.
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
I'm just...
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
I'm being sabotaged.
[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
I don't wanna move desks!
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
I'll do the best I can.
Good luck, Michael.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
On a boat.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
Yes! Andy, get out here.
You are kidding me!
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
I can't... [starts running]
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
She called you D?
I could tell, from the body language.
Well played.
Hey... Why did you do it?
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Yes you can.
Hey, it just takes one!
[trumpet sounds]
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
No.
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Coolio. Coolio.
Oh��� really.
David.
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
A little eye for an eye action.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Seven...
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Yeah, we���ll see about that.
[lying on Michael's desk] Hold me!
When I was asking about the leads.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Hey, hey!
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
[in bullhorn] Pull over!
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
Next suggestion.
I know you did.
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
Ha, nerd.
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Yeah? Like what?
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Not doing that.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
Jack Nicholas.
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
Five percent. No less.
Let's do this thing.
Oh, you get kicked.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
Stop it.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
Okay.
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
Had 'em all my life.
I'd think about it.
What?
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
So, I'm paying full price?
No, Michael.
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
I'm gonna save you!
[sighing]
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
That's how it's done.
So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
You promised us whales. These are worms.
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
And she is your boss.
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
Andy! [Jim mimes basketball shot]
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
I can see the security guard's eyes.
Yes..?
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
No communication with the outside world Jim.
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
Define scorched earth policy.
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
��� 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]
Not all the time.
I'm gonna take you home Michael.
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
One of the warehouse guys.
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
He looks like your twin.
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Thank you.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
It's true. We all walk alone.
You haven't buried her yet?
Sabotage.
It's not really 1992 anymore.
Danger.
Or real bombs.
Okay.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
Still.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
What are you looking at?
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
has brought...
No. No.
All right.
Question.
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
It's a sales call.
Damnit! Damnit Jim!
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
I have no idea.
Well don't look so surprised.
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
Thank you. [hangs up phone]
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
I don���t know, what do you mean?
Limbo, whoo!
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
Get in the back.
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
[gasps]Wait, the numbers!
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
And who is this 'the' Steve Nash?
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
I want that vice-presidency.
I've got a treat for you!
Yes. I would welcome it.
I got it.
[whispering] You set a date?
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
Thank you, Jim.
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Thank you, Sensei.
What?
I take full responsibility.
Hmm. It wasn't here before.
Movie idea?
No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
You know what you need? Closure.
So tape it down.
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
No!
Okay, what's next?
But you can say that about anything.
Good old Mose. [laughing]
Oui.
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
Thank you.
Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.
No, no, no.
Not good.
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
Mmhmm.
Your foot?
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For reha-
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
WE ARE WARRIORS!
Hello. Jim?
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
From the downsizing.
--to use sudden violence.
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
[struggling] Ahh! I can't-
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
Mm-hmm.
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
OK.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Yeah?
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Merry Christmas. Good.
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Oh, huggy hugs.
[wraps tape around Stanley���s body]
Silver medal.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
Thank you very much for that.
Sorry.
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
And wake up in the future.
Right, standard.
Did you enjoy your lunch?
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Maybe it's what she does here...
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
No.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
None of your business.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
[talking over Michael] Yes.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
Thank you very much.
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
[On Phone] One...
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
Okay.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
I broke it.
Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
How would you do that?
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
What position did you use to conceive?
And it's-
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
Right here.
They should not be in that room.
Uh huh.
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Just now.
Yeah pretty much.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Gahh!
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Gotcha! Why are you late?
Surveillance, gaming- and business.
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
Jim, what do you say?
Guten tag, Herr Michael.
How's it hanging?
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
Good. Good. And...
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
Thank you.
Where?
I know...
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
No way.
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
Yes!
You took that with you.
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
...the fact...
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
Hey guys.
Yeah.
But I don't have any...
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
I am hardly the problem, Jim.
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
No you're not.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
[on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Are those real pearls?
What's a dis... what's that?
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
And who had your office?
Yeah!
These covers are totally indestructible.
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
It's all right. It's all right.
Well rested.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
Smart baby. That���s the most flavorful bond.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
Really?
I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Sure.
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
That's just a verb.
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Yes, exactly!
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
When is the Paleolithic Age?
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
Just admit you lost track of time.
Could be.
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
Here they come.
Seventy-two hours.
Yeah I���m serious.
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
No way!
Move to the side of the road!
[counts down in French]
[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
C���mon.
He doesn't like it.
I didn't lose my desk.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Okay.
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
RAHHH!!!!!!!
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
But you're the one who picked today.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
[clears throat]
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
That suit is amazing.
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
No.
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
Ow! God!
Oh I am. In my own words.
Gosh. He he.
Can I talk to you about something?
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
Hello.
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
That's my client.
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
Okay, okay.
Loyalty.
You could ask for an extension.
I'm not gonna say it.
I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
Mmm.  [nods]
Like a wolf. Thank you.
But then you wouldn't have me here.
...from the 1930's...
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
You'll be fine over there.
Yes.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
$30,000? There's gotta be another way.
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
What is the matter with... me?
Pam, please call security!
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
Michael, nice tie or something.
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
No.
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Hey stranger.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
Really, that's your real name?
Oh, no. What's wrong?
Not counting the last one, 25.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Yep. He'll be fine.
We have... a bat... in the office.
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
Try Dwight.
[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.
Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
This is so awesome.
Wait. Are you saying...
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
What?
Aha! A lightbulb.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
She should thank me.
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
I don't think she'd be missed.
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Reply it!
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
Hiii! [kicks Michael]
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
I want Michael to take me...
[pantless] OK, how is my voice now?
Did you do her?
Get up off your desks!
Who is Justice Beaver?
No.
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
I was here first.
Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
What are you doing?
This is smaller than your old place.
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
What is this?
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
Fine.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Dwight Schrute.
Don't you want a sheath for that?
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Me! Me, me, me.
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Okay.
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
Dwight Schrute.
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]
$100 a day, plus expenses.
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
It's non-transferable...
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Sure.
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
If I guess, will you tell me?
Who are you talking to?
[tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!
Just ugly enough to have deniability.
It's a lullaby.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Diversifying. Smart.
[coughs sentence] You're the idiot!
No, not me.
No.
[Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in!
It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
Oh...
It���s him! Do something! Get out!
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
Coopers has calamari.
Oh, that's my last one.
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
No, you don't.
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
I'm sorry, Michael
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
Or none of you [chuckles]
Oh, they're forming an alliance
It's complicated.
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
What is the capital of Maine?
Michael, I need to talk to you.
None taken. What do you got?
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
Troy, do you know anything about this?
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
Good Morning!
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
[standing up] Get out.
That was your idea.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
I'm all better.
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Welcome aboard.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
Yes, Michael.
About what?
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
Hold your breath.
Yeah, let's go.
It's in Maryland.
Michael is your superior.
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
No one just called you.
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
There were only two options.
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
Shotgun weddings.
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Yes.
Always. [runs off]
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
Are you serious?
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Some of these kernels have crowned.
Pam!
Good morning Michael.
I'm pumped!
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
[laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!
[throws ���now��� beanbag at Jim] Now.
Shh Shh.
Let's go.
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
I saw that. That's great!
Alright.
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Yes.
Jeb, my brother.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
Might get ugly.
What?
Extend the fingers more.
What do you mean?
How?
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Eiffel Tower.
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
Like hell you are.
Hazel.  They're hazel.
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
I will.
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
Define foment.
Huh? You like that?
Did he threaten you?
[Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Where did you read that?
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
Absolutely I would not.
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
I want to see the baby.
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
N... it's complicated.
Tell him, not Dwight.
Give me the dice.
Classy.
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
[again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
Peepa, how is she?
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Not like this.
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
I have a girlfriend...
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
Let me see.
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
Awesome!
On an innocent baby.
Psh, why is that great?
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
Hey.
Done.
I got it. I got it.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
Troy!  What are you doing here?
Watch your step.
Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Never!
Oh. I got it.
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
[grunts] Let���s take him���
Can I have an office?
No wait, what are you doing?!
[on the phone] Oh my God!
We'll see.
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Cause you're sweeter than candy.
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Shut up. That's impossible.
Ow.
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
Why Jim?
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
Now what?
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
I found it under the seat.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
Same thing.
Oh give me a break.
Yes.
It's a common question.
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
Pam, I'll help you.
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
Come here. Come here.
Hey, Michael.
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Hey, we nailed the sale!
All their top clients I can't believe it.
You are out of order.
Hello.
Your fictitious name?
Stop it!
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
I got sofa. I got sofa.
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
That's good enough for me. [exhales again]
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
Yes, you did.
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
What?
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
I don���t see it.
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
Good night.
Yeah.
That���s a bit extreme.
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
You mean, like a ham?
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
That's preposterous.
That is so cool.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Jim talked too much.
All right, let's do this.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
And flexible.
It's not rabid.
Okay.
What?
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
Come on.
Yeah.
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
Wait, what?  You can't take what?
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
[on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
Obviously. I knew it.
[taps Jim's hand with his foot]
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
Dunder-Mifflin.
We need to talk!
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Just for a minute.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
Leave the keys.
Make him be quiet.
Mm hm.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Any brothers or sisters?
[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?
I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Yep.
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Stupid.
[laughs] With sex!
But that's illegal.
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry.
You did?
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
[clears throat] Knock, knock.
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
[smiles]
Not you, Erin.
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Hey. Hey. Jerry.
All right. Are you okay?
[low] Oh God, here.
[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.
Bow down before Recyclops.
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
What?
I do not have a knife!
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
Of course I saw it.
Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
[innocently] How'd that get there?
Pretty good.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
Yeah.
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
Great.
Shut up.
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
350 and one penny.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Does it specify which windshield?
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
No.
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
Inspiration.
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Then I refuse.
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
You read my mind.
(takes out bag) 40. Always.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
Danny Cordray is the worst.
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
No holding.
I could've gotten that, idiot!
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
No.
OK, what am I thinking right now?
Watch this.
Look at that one.
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
Jim! Open the door!
Why do they call him The Bus?
Apology rejected.
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
This is where I saw that deer last week.
I decided earlier.
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
That!
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Ah! [throws punch] That���s how it���s done.
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
It's in the name.
No women or children, unless provoked.
Give me the hose!
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Okay. What'd you get?
What are you doing?
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
Fresh hot ink.
Yes I did.
Ah!
Security deposit. That's been-
Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
One word.
What is your name, sir?
Hustle!
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Yes. And my decision in final.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
Five, four, three, two...
Aww, Darryl.
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
What do you think I am saying to you?!
Very smart.
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Same thing.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
Oscar is out sick.
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Seedless?
Who, me?
No.
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Fine.  Good.
You know what? I'm a little busy.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Oh my God, she told you?
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Kind of.
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
Yeah, do tell.
Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
Michael, can you explain?
Tonight.
Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
Ask him about the party.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
Oh, our contract.
I got it here.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Yeah...
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
Yes.
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
Fail!
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Impossible, I love the law.
Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
There you go!
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
Woo-hoo.
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
No, okay.
Wow.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...
OK. Good night Ryan.
All Right!
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Sure.
Come on. Come on.
Cut.
Oh, hey, I���ll take a coffee.
YEAH!
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
And anoth���
Door. Chair. It���s about Phillip.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Master bee.
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
What?
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
No, I can't... I ca...
Different guy.
Michael.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Where are all the animals?
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
Just a possibility.
What were you doing in there?
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
Cool.
So I can lower it.
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
It's the ladies' room.
Ha! I don't get it.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
You're gonna need to be more specific.
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Outside of work.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
OK. [looks at watch and leaves]
I most certainly did not.
Yeah.
You can���t have someone murdered.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
You said that?
Thank you.
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
Fumble! Yaaah!
Assistant Sensei.
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
Mmm-hmm.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
Probably. [walks away with beans]
No kidding.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
You know there's a ghost in this office
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
Where?
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
Was she talkin' back?
Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Yeah, but no one here has it.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Can I be team captain?
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
Hey.
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Okay. Let's go. Step up.
You wanted to see me?
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
That���s me.
Text went through.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
I will.
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
God... Damn it! Why us?
Con artist.
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
Push!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Winners!
Really?
Did you even read the memo?
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
I miss her so much.
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
What do you think you're doing?
Bildenkinder.
Toby...
Don't tell Michael...
What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Oh, you wish.  Hellboy's a hero.
Getting defensive?
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
[with a small fist pump] Yes!
Poor hornet.
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
Come on pretty boy.
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
All you have to do it say it.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
Michael.
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
Would that make you happy?
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Cause I could look it up real easily.
Still an important position. Still a chief.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
[whispers] Don't let-shh!
Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
Not yet.
Copy. Thank you.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
No.
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
[box falls over] Oh.
On one condition. You...
You have to tell me.
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
What else does it look like?
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
You can't tantalize me.
Who is this?
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
What did I say!?
I'm on it!
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Jim.
Hey, did you SMS text message me?
He/she/it throat rips.
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
He sure left in a hurry.
I don't know...
Is that how they like to get in?
[drinks] Mmmmm...
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Okay, I'll drive.
Oh, okay.
-But we'll be together then-'
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Oh, yes.
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
It's a mini-briefcase.
Shampoo.
I was -- I was right.
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
I don't ... have no idea.
No, that is huge.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
just drink a lot of water.
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
Jim. Definitely.
You really want Packer as your boss?
So can we come in?
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Jim, Michael's office.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Andy, I can't hear this right now.
Would you like the stink sack?
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
What is that?
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
The most important one of the guys.
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Do you have your card?
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Later on.
What is?
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Pam?
Michael, I don't know...
Well, that didn't go well.
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
None of your business, Jim.
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Mm-hmm.
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
We're here. [gets out of the car]
[laughs] I think you know.
Hey monkey, what's up?
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Him or me?
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Told you.
Oh, thank you.
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Uh, bumper's sagging.
That's our theme.
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.
Oh my gosh.
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
My calls?
I will tell on you.
Oh! [collapses]
Michael.
You���re telling me!
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
Time for me to find out.
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
I found twins.
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
No, it's an accountability booster.
Michael!?
Uh huh.
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Go on.
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Yeah!
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Seriously?
You're back.
If you want.
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
Stop forgetting things.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
I will never, ever let you down.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
Yeah! [laughing]
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
This is the lake!
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
How do I apply?
You and me, Michael. Yes!
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
No!
What's the square footage?
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Please sir! Spare him. Please.
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Hey, hey. Easy.
Does Michael talk about
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!
Ahh-chaa!
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
I was trying to go-
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
That's exactly what I said.
Nothing. [puts down binoculars]
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
I've got the key.
Jan knows paper.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
It's not what you think.
I'm not.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
At what time?
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Men find me desirable.
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
I know. I know exactly what to do.
Is that a sumo suit?
Crap.
I see Esther's back in town.
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
That's where they remove the uterus.
Okay, I just...
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
Angela, you're up.
It's not the greatest one either...
[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray]
You wanna eat, don't you?
It's gorgeous.  Let's go!
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
American Idol? What? No.
That's my stopwatch.
You can't steal what is legally your property.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
-Cornell Application Department,
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
Bring it.
We heard it was called red-vining.
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
Very good.
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
Hmm?
Okay, I'm on it!
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Sorry.
Up here. [whistles]
I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
Saleswoman has a vagina.
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
Good.
I'm not-- I'm not following you.
I know.
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
OK, our prices have never been lower.
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
So you excited?
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
Yeah!
He looks great.
You didn't have to...
Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim���s leg.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
And you want me to come with you.
Done.
Cool, let's start with the banisters.
I don���t need your help.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
I....
Not my problem.
I'm barren, Jim.
He wouldn't listen to me
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Yes!
Argh!
OK, what's up?
Dear God in heaven.
Really make one.
Good.
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Wow. Did your baby draw that?
You're good.
How ya doin'?
Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
Guilty!
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Not a viable option.
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
We will be called Gryffindor.
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
That's a realistic time line.
Give me it. I am not.
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
You can't.
It's close.
Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
I will know.
[coolly] Seems like you already know where.
I���ve seen enough.
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
[laughs] Nice.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
Ah! Not so fast.
Take six.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
And your affiliation with Cornell -
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
In which direction?
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Hey, what was she like?
No.
Whoa. Michael.
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Go ahead and just read the frosting.
As has Angela!
Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
Yeah, deal with it Pam!
I hit a bear.
Come on.
I've had intercourse in the office.
Exactly.
I think you need to confess...
[sighs] You're an idiot.
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
It's only twenty-five bucks.
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
Good. How are you doing?
Don't say cow- Ugh.
The democratic primaries,
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
No. Putting a load on more like it.
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?
[to camera] Same thing.
Shh, shh, shh.
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
Ah damn pop-ups.
Let it out.
No, but that's sometimes part of it.
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
This is how I breathe.
I have been my whole life.
...Okay.
Not a word.
But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Let's do it!
Your clients. They're all mine.
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
No it is not.
That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
Death to Toby!
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
Oh really?
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
���Gy-na��� said that?
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
They are either going to say yes... or no.
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
I think she's efficient.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Did you get anything good?
I love you!
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Cats don't make butter.
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Did you see the board?
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
You have information about the sex predator?
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
Okay scram, wizard.
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Admit it. Admit it.
Okay! Come on!
No way, it's the KGB.
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
Return it!  Return it now!
I will pay you whatever it takes.
No.
No. Jim, come on.
OK, I'm ready.
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Hey, Andy.
What kind of filing?
Michael, wait. Let me go.
What? I believe it.
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
Mine was green.
Please.
I put everything back in the vending machine.
No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!
I think I should be there.
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
I can... Yes, sensei.
Really?
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Good. [Pam overhears]
All Right
Ingredients.
I have an old barn!
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
What did you do? Huh?
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Yeah.
Meet my eye line, Jim!
Yes.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
Just rock. Shh.
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
I am nigh!
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
No need to thank me.
Hey buddy, so every-
Sh-what?
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
You need to do something about your B.O.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Watch this part, okay?
It's from both of us.
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
Is that what we were doing?
God. How do whalers do it?
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
Ok.
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
Aggggh, that stings!
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
Empty mind.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
You guys should use a hand truck.
I'll glance at it.
No... no. One crisis at a time.
With all my heart.
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
Does he have access to their medical records?
Kill or be killed.
I'm not cr-- uhh!
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?
Oh, please.
He's gonna love it!
Whassup!
Shove it through! Break it!
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
Great idea.
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant
What?
Waste of time.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Just a formality.
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
Gabe? You don't know?
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
Aah!
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
Let's go.
Jim. I���m not kidding. I need you.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
Yeah.
Need any help?
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
It is?
It smells like chicken soup.
[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
I'll get someone to take it down.
You're thinking of a chicken.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Aren't they magnificent?
Queen's higher.
Not the living in fear, that's new.
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Sensei, you���re not watching.
He turned over my...
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Yes.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Six percent, I know my worth.
Yum.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
Nice, very nice.
In the ocean.
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
[show her the wound] Oh God.
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Who are you calling?
Me.
Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
How as being a minority affected you?
I am not.
Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Hallowed ground.
Yeah. What?
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Word.
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
Welcome.
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
I apologized for that.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
This is how business...
Get your foot behind the yellow line.
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
[coughing] It's still stinky.
That was the sick one, right?
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Oh. Of course.
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
Will end completely!
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
Where are you?
Okay. [looks ashamed]
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
What happened?
Yes.
[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!
Clown paint.
No! Really?
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
Mm, great cake.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
Uhh.
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
I knew it.
Jim!
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
Out of loyalty to this company...
P.S. We should should kill him.
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
[sighs] Please? Please?
Mm-hm.
You know it.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Wolves.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
Menstrual cycles.
I got it.
You know what?
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
You'll fall in love with her.
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Jim.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Please.
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
You're number four.
Do it.
Hey, what are you listening to?
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
He hung up?
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
That's not how it works.
This party is going to be awesome.
Oh, you're kidding me!
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
Come here, I���ll show you.
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
Everybody!
Yep.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
[removes glasses] I am the bait.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
We're gonna bust this guy.
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
Who cares.
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
Thanks.
I want to do it.
He knew all along!
[shuts door on him] Great.
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
It's in my purse.
That laugh is so infectious.
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
I hope there will be management parables.
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
No need we can just check the security tapes.
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
[spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
Done.
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
It's by the ream?
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Oh!
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Okay?
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
Andy.
Eh, I've been sitting all day.
Is it?
[to troy] Do you have powers?
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Rolph, leave it alone!
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
What's it of?
Like this? Watch.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Like in a cup?
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Michael, you know I can't take this.
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Yes you will.
You already said deal.
You're so immature!
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
You're the one who trained me, Michael.
Hello.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
Yeah!
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
That's not why you lost.
Are you laughing at me?
Jackpot.
I work with Michael.
She's not here, Jim.
Wow.
Michael, we have a situation.
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
You know how I feel about IHOP.
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
That is correct.
What'd he say? What did he say?
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
If you say screw you one more time...
You're wearing loafers!
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
Do you know what 'snap decision' means?
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
Michael?
I have to see these shoes.
Humans are terrible for the environment.
Okay, okay. That's enough.
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
Shut up.
Eh.
Oh good. She broke up with you.
Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
Well, it should be.
No.
You apologize right now.
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
What?
And you'll compare the times?
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
Alleged contract.
[frightened] Uh!
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
[sighs] Now, how can I help you?
Okay.
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
No!
To intimidate my subordinates.
Looks serious.
Oh no, no, no.
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
....back orders and you never called them.
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
No no no the first part.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Jim, move!
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
No, please don't do this, monkey.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Hey, hey.
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
My hip bone!
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
I have to put you on with my boss.
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
Xterra's not even a real word.
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
Yeah.
Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
Why him?
[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
Right. Which one is that?
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
You don't want to know.
That is so great about the bonus!
To do something about-
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Uh-huh.
And I turned it down.
That's unacceptable.
[clears throat] 'I state my regret.'
Really.
[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Mega-Desk.
Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
Eager.
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
[whispers] Yeah.
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Jim!
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Yes!
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
You must use a lot of paper.
You failed?
Action.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Ahh!
Ready?
Hey.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
You've got a ton of dandruff.
I sa- [Andy honks his horn]
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Stay out of this, you!
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Yeah, you know me.
What is it?
Do you want to die? OUT!!
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Damn.  [thinks]  I'll try Brookstone.
Ready?
What branch?
So what do you want?
What? It's a casual, social outfit.
[smiling] No thank you.
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Just run! Take the stairs!
Bull... [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
Coolio.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
Oh, I'm equipped... I can...
[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Wing.
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
What's this? What is this?
That���s right Jim.
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
I'm on it.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Okay, I can do that.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Keep them.
Please Michael, please.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
He wasn't volunteering today.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
Pushing on.
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Can I do some of the talking?
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Where's your tie?
Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
Okay---
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
Oh, my God.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
What is a scented candle?
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Quiet you.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Same thing.
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Smile!
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
I just might be his father.
Ok, I get it.
As Assistant Regional Manager...
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
Thank you. [everyone begins to leave]
It was Andy's idea.
Very funny Jim.
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
I'm not answering it.
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
What?
I'm doing my job.
Oh we know.
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
He doesn't even know that I do that.
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
But you work tomorrow.
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Drop this one. Abort.
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Well, you have...
Single... OK.
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
She probably scrubbed it
...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's]
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Gonna get it?
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
With my leads and stuff like that?
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
I checked it more than once.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
No.
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
[laughing together] Yeah!
Yes you did.
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
Not literally.
What?
Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
...and then we compare notes.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
What?
Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
Eh, it's not worth it.
I...
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
Hey Santa!
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
[whispering] He's my best customer.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
Okay.
I had fish yesterday.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
I'll order you some cranberry juice.
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
You have your lawyer there?
Well, I did it too.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
He's not a songbird.
Thanks so much Earl.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
[talking over Michael] Nice.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
What did you do?
Okay. [sits]
Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
I have two. White and Indian.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
What?
Vagina and-
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Michael? Please! Come on!
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Question? May I investigate?
Yes! We advance to the next round!
[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]
[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
Let me see your ID.
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Take me to his house.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
No.
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
Hmm.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
You heard me!
Terrible!
Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
They have some great kitchen ideas.
[attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!
My idea!
Damn it!
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
What?
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
MIS... MI... What are you doing?
Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
What?
Just hush.
[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
David, is that you?
It would be better if you were unconscious.
How dare you all attack him like this.
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
What?
Michael?
Michael?
What?
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
[on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
A bat! Impressive...
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Fifty L.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
People who don't trust egg whites.
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
I'm on it.
Yeah!
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
Okay.
I'm gonna with the python.
Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
How much do you have?
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
How about Scrantonstrangler666.
[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
(smirking) Exactly.
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
[pause] What?
Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
Attention blue collar workers!
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
Hello, Jan.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
Give me the dice!
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Yes!
Right.
Crisis averted.
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Feast on this, Lewis.
Thank you.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
Uh huh.
Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
No.
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
What are you-
Oh.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
Wow!
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
So excited.
Know what?
I wish I could hire all of you.
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Oh D.
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
Yup.
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
What is the antidote?
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Possibly.
Walk out of the house...
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
Has Michael checked in?
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
So, you--
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
It was my pants.
It's going to be ok.
Mm-hmm.
Got it.
[finds shoe box] Ooh.
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
You've done more then you can possibly know.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
I love finding a good set of twins.
Queen bee.
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
How long has he been in the bathroom?
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
Y el accento, donde are you from?
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Got it.  Carb up.
There you go.
Stanley.
Yes?
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
That was the last signature I needed.
Eh, its not that early.
Don't leave us!
Oh, man!
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
That's impossible.
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
Watch and learn.
You were on a boat.
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
Yes!
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
[entering office] What's going on?
Okay, Jim.
Fax this for me.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
With the crotch.
Wait, wait, wait.
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Take a good look at this boy...
Wait, what girlfriend?
What do you think?
Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.
And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Absolutely... not.
Yeah!
That is all. Have a good morning.
Interesting choice...
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
Good.
Good. Really really good.
What are you doing?
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
It's actually better this way.
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
MR. RYAN HOWARD!
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
I know how we can learn his tricks.
Thank you.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Speaking of pimples, let���s release the BLOGGERS!
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
Michael, come on.
You are an impressive specimen.
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
[tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Yes? What is the meaning of this?
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
No.
Women look like white slaves.
...I'll consider it.
Yeah!
What is your weapon?
Assistant team manager?
No, you stop.
Maybe you should.  Whatever.
Wait, what Holly said?
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
We all have a hero in our heart.
No.
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
It's about adapting to the circumstances.
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
No.
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
F. Alright, what's the damage?
[sighs] This is your job, Halpert.
Yeah.
No.
He went to Gabe behind your back.
That's what she said.
Good luck to you. [disconnects call]
A thousand times more.
Yes.
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Well I'm not responsible for that!
Yes!
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
Dumatril!
No.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Oh, why not?
Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
He says Thank you.
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
It's from Battlestar Galactica.
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
[singing]  ... Marilyn Monroe!
Jim, put those away.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
You don't know what you need. Just...
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
No I don't.
Hey. Enjoy your new clump.
Oh, that's perfect!
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
No.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
Let's go check out the master bedroom.
She's sleeping with you?
This is a bus transfer.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
You have never been cooler.
Michael! My water's breaking!
Nine and three-quarters.
I'll have to talk to the manager.
That is not in the contract.
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
Ding dong.
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
What?
Amazing.
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
You don't have email on your phone.
It is not a B and B.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
Don���t listen to him.
No, I like Meredith.
[shouting] Haulin' cube!
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Does that include the garage?
No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Think!
So who will be your new Number Three?
Screwed.
Can you give me a second, sir.
You're not on
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
The Crow.
I never said it was better than an iPod.
No, that was my Sensei.
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Oh, I like it.
What are you doing?
(Bleep)
Thirty-two meatballs.
Yes, I was quilled.
Here, here��� Just���
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
No, Michael!
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
[smirking] Oh, yeah.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Think it through.
Don't make me do this the hard way.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
BAT!
[surprising Kelly] Aha!
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
Thank you, Angela.
State your business!
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Why's he talking to Holly?
Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Downsizing?
The Dundies!
Sure
Cri-Man-Squa?
Mmm-hmm.
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
Hmm?
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
What are some of your small business ideas?
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Excellent.
[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Yes!
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
Huh?
Pleasure.
Why? I don't understand.
No! [arguing over each other]
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
You have to interview me...
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
[over phone] Who is that monkey?
Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
Yeah. It's practical.
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
No.
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Let's get back to work.
Word.
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
What?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
Hope to see you soon.
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Yes.
Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Perhaps.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
You've already been several times.
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
Idiot.
[alarm sounds] People!
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
Eight minutes!
Jim!
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
Do you own a gun?
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
You have till five.
What do you want!?!
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
Oscar...
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
C���mon, c���mon.
Jan's here.
Yes.
That's fine.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Yeah, Andy.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
What?
Where did you see it?
Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
Yes.
Great, right up there.
I don't get to wear my ties.
Screwgun. The sales call!
To keep secrets from my computer.
I have crossbows.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Is this Jan?
No, absolutely not.
[laughs] What do you think?
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Correct.
Everything's a joke.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Inventor of the cotton gin.
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Dry rot?
Jim is essential to th-
[agreeing] Mm.
He does? What does he say.
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Just wait and send it to voicemail.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
What's jazz hands?
Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Oh, God.
No, Michael.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
Ok, let him know that I'm here.
Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
The leads are in?
I wish I could menstruate.
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
Toby...
What's up-dog?
Go. Get the door.
You wanted to see me?
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
Having trouble finding a vein?
Come on.
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Argggg!
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
I don't need a key.
Zeke.
Go move some paper!
I had a tickle in my throat.
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
[surprised] Ah!
Party's over. You are so busted!
Fosters in the big can.
KGB.
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
None of your business.
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
Way to go.
Jim, you're the new schedule guy, huh?
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
And I have to say your leadership...
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Look, we're twins.
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
Parley, my office, five minutes.
That is my idea.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
N-no there's not.
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
We have better service than they do!
Get in.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
Forget it. I'll look it up myself.
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Ok
That's a common swindlers trick.
Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Where did you get those?
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
You are?
Oh, man!
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
Come on, break this up.
Not��� significant is a big word���
Game on!
Big day for you.
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
Happy birth moment, Michael.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Just say it.
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
Yow!
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
Good.
Unbelievable.
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Hey monkey.
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
I
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
Impish or admirable.
...never been lower!
[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.
No, hmmm... that's still...
Ahh! OK!
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
[whispering] I want some of those pills.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
Fire hazard.
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
No trades.
Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Yes!
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
Perfect casting, right?
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
She's only a cat.
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Losers.
Welcome.
Who is the king of Austria?
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
No problem.
Okay?
Hey, this is none of your business.
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
The pressure!  The pressure!
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
That's it.
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
No? Then you are an idiot.
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
YEAH!
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
I don't think she'd be missed.
Okay, let's go.
Why not call...
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly]
So who are we laughing at?
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
Really?
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
What is it? Who wrote it?
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
Marching or garage?
You stop.
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
Please, I'll make you proud.
Don't make me pre-fire you.
I will stay here and run things on this end.
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Kelly is disqualified!
[Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!
Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
[giggles]
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Why is she marrying Andy?
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
So?
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
No. [typing on keyboard]
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
It does, but still no.
Thank you, Michael.
No. Why not do it now?
Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
Yeah....baby.
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
You did this, didn't you?
Hello, Angela.
Is somebody after you?
I'll have a cup of a coffee.
You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
Oh, don���t worry. They���ll get got.
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
Thank you, Andy.
[chuckles]
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
That's good, let's wrap it up.
Don't.
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
Taste good too.
Oh God.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Michael, I...
Men find me desirable.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
A hunter.
Yeah, you said...
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
Uh, duh.
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Surprise! [laughs]  Everybody!
No.
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
Of course.
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Damn it. God!
Yes.
You didn't have to.
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
I don't want to do this.
Am I nomadic?
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
No.
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Step lively. Single file everybody.
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
Put some ice on it.
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
Like Angela in accounting.
Emergency dentist appointment.
Say it again.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
How about 5:15?
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Yes, please.
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Breathing. Is that you?
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
It's that easy?
What are you saying?
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
You sure?
[kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
Part of my job.
I see dead people.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
100%.
Rule two: we stop at nothing.
[clapping] Best Dundies ever.
Some of these people are for real.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
Yes!
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Kiyah!
[Dwight groans] Ugh.
Ok, Pam, thanks.
How many in your party?
Where are you taking the client list?
Those are fighting words.
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Michael.
Do you accept?
Come on. Nice try, Josh!
Ready?!
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
And he made us all look like chumps!
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
How close?
Okay.
Just lice Pam?
I knew it. Is it waterproof?
Oh.
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
I just saved your life. You���re welcome!
Judas.
I'm great. How are you?
Um.
You can't do that.
Hit the nos.
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
When? When did he tell you? Today?
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
Cmon.
Get in!
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
It was playful hazing.
That's just absurd.
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
You're supposed to be a cat?
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
No!
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
Fence with a hole in it..
Here's another place.
Can I be team manager?
Hey.
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
[sighs]
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Which we can't know.
Give me that.
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
The city of Atlanta.
Yeah, get them, Creed!
It is time to unveil the tree.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
So, let's get it going.
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
Ready?
No.  I think you should date Kelly.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
What the hell is this?
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
Hey, Toby.
Yes!
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
Uh. [eats antacids]
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
No.
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
Hope - grows.
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
Yours doesn't.
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
Leave, get outta here.
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
Everyone.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
Not now! Private time!
Two more.
Man, what is taking Toby so long?
No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
But don't forget you owe me $10.
You need-
I'll call you back.
Yes.
I know.
Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
Which one is it?
Take me to Robert.
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
Are you nuts?
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
OK you are useless.
Everybody loves beets.
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
Exactly. Yes.
Fine. Get outta here.
No, [mumbling] I don't know.
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
No, no, no, no...
You're the stupid one.
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
Oh, God!
Let me out.
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
Hey, temp.
[whispering] What do you need from me?
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
Okay. Fine.
You know we live together, right?
Mm-hmm. Good luck.
That doesn't make any sense.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
It's only Meredith.
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
Warf.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
NO!
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
It's simpler this way.
Wow! Lot of calories.
So tell me.
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
How dare you?
Oh.
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
Or get hit by a car-
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
No questions.
You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
You���re working for ���Stumpany��� too?
Not now, Temp.
Give me the punch card.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
[eating banana] Mm, less than three.
God!
What? Are there two suns?
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
What's your blood type?
Ok. First impressions?
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
I was just jogging.
[picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]
Into your-
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
Yeah, but no nipples.
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Oh, it's so wet.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Saturday.
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
No.
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
Um.
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
What kind of mortgage did you get?
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
Kelly?
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
Two charges of loitering,
Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
Mm.
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
You don't keep a diary.
Hello.
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
[exclaims] Atherozar!
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Yes.
No.
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
...noted.
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
Very good.
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
I have.
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
[unimpressed] Really?
Hey.  No movement.
I'm on it.
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
You're lying. We didn't win.
Watching?
Put your fingers here.
No.
[whispering] You okay?
Look, I will not pay.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
No, I have not.
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
To be burned!
OK, I accept it.
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
Really?
It's early bird gets the worm.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
You apologize to me right now.
Alright.  I'll call you, kid.
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
Who's the target?
Damn it! Jim!
He's lying.
[employees chuckle] And he
You throat-rip.
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
Aaaaah!
[sighs] It's firm.
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Of course you are.
pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
I choose Michael!
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
You'll see. Here we go.
Damn it!
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Thank you.
Answer me this, though.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
What does it look like?
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
Come on.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
I am a person.
Any employee may dispose a food item...
Michael.
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
Care for a piece of chocolate?
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
Brought it in here-
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
Come on!
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
And Dwight.
Describe it.
Frosting.
Admit that there is a chance.
No the other thing.
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
What? You?
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
I don't follow.
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
We don't take debit cards, anyway.
I left a message at corporate.
Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
Okay.
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
I'm not answering that. You answer it.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
But I'm right?
What's going on?
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
What are you writing about me?
So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Standing.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
Walkie-talkies.
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Oh... no... really?
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
[fires tranquilizer gun twice]
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Mmm hmm.
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Three to four hours.
Spin move.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
My cousin Mose told me a joke.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
What are you doing?
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Yup.
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
My title has 'Manager' in it.
Okay.
Angela.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
China is on the move?
No, he shouldn���t.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
What?
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
[applause] Yes! Thank you!
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Well, this is it.
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
No you can't do that.
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Ghaaa!
Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?
Woohoo!
Okay.
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
No.
Search his things.
Really?
What is going on?
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Yeah.
She sent an email, so.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
You don't like the Beatles?
Michael would never let me...
Come on.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Don't set it to yourself!
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
You���re bad.
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Nice.
I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
Don't do it, Michael.
What are the specs?
I'll be back, I mean...
I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
Get your clouds right.
Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Exactly.
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
Let's talk pubes, people.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
Lake Erie.
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
You want me to flush him?
Did you get your tickets?
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Please, I can double your pace.
Way to go man, Jan's really hot.'
There it is. [everyone applauds]
[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
Such a chorus girl.
What?
It's, it's latched closed.
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
[smiles] That's two things.
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Jim, this is hardly the time.
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
Yeah, trust me.
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
Yep, he's lying.
What?
Keep an existing...
Oh my god.
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
Are you referring to alchemy?
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
Jim, don't interfere.
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
What box?!
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
Ok, what are they?
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Pam was supposed to get 'em.
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Leave the keys!
Anything else?  Flint...
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Of course.
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL!
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
You���re a good assistant, Jim.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Sorry.
Hi, Mr. Bart.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
I could have stopped him.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
I'm not good at jokes.
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
...so good.
Who took all the black ones?
I'm just --
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
I want a truce.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Okay, get out of here.
Huh. Do you like candy?
No, but we should discuss that another time.
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
[throws hard, Jim doesn���t catch] Nice catch.
Ok.
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
It is the situation that we are in now.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Oh my gosh, now she's up.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]
Is that the last year the data was available?
What are you doing?
Waste of time.
Undistributable.
Uh-huh.
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
Wow--
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
Dumatril.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
Yes.
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
Big smiles folks! There they are.
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
What's so funny?
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
Good. They good?
Okay.
Chicken fight!
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Tape recorder.
You'll have Pam to answer to.
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Do you have the Sharpie?!
Nametag?
[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Found him!
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
Oh my god.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
There's a hose out back.
Oh, not gonna happen.
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
You don't work with us.
It can���t be nothing.
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
All right then. Someone propose a plan.
God... Damn it! Why us?
Wow!
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
I love that show.
Yeah, right.
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
Where were you yesterday after work?
Yeah, that'll work.
Steak. Rare.
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
It's Christmas Toby.
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
It���s moments away. Just stay here!
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
Okay that's-
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
[coughing]
We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
Well, I���m the one offering the job.
The fire guy! The fire guy!
A net? a giant net?
Give me the phone.
[imitating '80s rock]
Go. Push!
Accepted.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
No.
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
I knew you would, Nancy.
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
That���s true.
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Oh, this could be a juicy one.
Please tell me. I've been so good...
Does it have a deck?
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Consider it?
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
Silence?
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
Who's the father?
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Whoa!
Oh yeah?
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Yes, it is. Carry on.
Oh, just...
You're a secretary! What do you know?
Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
You're leaving?
My cervix is ripening.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
uhhhh....no one.
No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces']
Okay!
Yeah, Meredith.
About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].
And one girl push-up.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
No, you know what? You do it.
And circle gets the square.
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
All right.
Clarice?
Yeah!
Thank you.
Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Ok
We had already applauded.
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
It's okay, I smell.
Michael!  What's wrong?
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
Ryan.  Come on, man?
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
Okay.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
...'cause there's no comeback for that.
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
What's your win rate?
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
I'll have Pam send out a memo.
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
He's very, very handsome.
[laughing] Boom!
Hey, how's it going, man?
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
What? Why would you say that���
You know me.
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
Yeah.
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
A few of the ground rules?
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
[to camera] Same thing.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
I do that myself now.
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
[to old man] Okay, you're done.
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
This is stupid! Cut.
I do!
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
Parka...
I...
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Ah, much, ok.
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Goodbye.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
Why?
Yep.
Yes!
Yes, Monkey.
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Wash your hands, Kevin.
You know what this is?
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
OK.
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Two to three hours...
I���m trying, but what you���re asking is--
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
God.  Where is Jim?
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
You have it?
No, you're too close.
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Same page. Just keep moving.
That's great.
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
Do it now.
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Hola, tu es une buena worker?
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Hello.
I call for a refold!
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Please? Please, Pam?
Move to the exits!
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
Nice.
Good shocks.
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
What does it say?
I think it was Creed.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
Yes.
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
Jim, get him a water.
Michael, it's Phyllis.
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
Aaaaaaaa!
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
We did it!
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
Have you ever seen a burn victim?
She was stoned apparently.
Butter. Newborns are slippery.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
Because we're friends.
While you were gone...
What will you do?
Aah!
No.
Angela, what about you?
Yes.
Wake up! [Cathy screams]
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
Really?
I have a smudge on my forehead?
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Do you love her?
[applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
Robert.
I can see that happening, yes.
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile���nod. Smile and nod.
Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
You can be so modest sometimes.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Yeah. I can barely...
Robert! Robert California! Robert!
[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
Michael, it's time.
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Fine!
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Very well.
What?
Where are they?
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
500 and one penny.
Oscar.
What did you just call him?
Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
Hungry?
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
This is war and that is what happens.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
Exactly.
No way. What if I meet someone?
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Damn it.
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
OK, everybody just calm down.
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
Don't you dare! Andy!
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
What are you mumbling about?
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
There is no shower.
Good. Real good.
That's not true.
That's a ridiculous question.
Vamping.
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
I smell mold.
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
Terrible mistake.
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
But you still work for Wired, right?
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
[Shakes head]
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
What!
Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
Oh.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
What?
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
[begins playing recorder]
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
Do you need anything?
Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
Andy���[knocks] I need to talk to you.
Yes.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
Then make him pitch to you.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
[over phone] Hey-O!
Yeah.
Check out Dental?
No. You will not.
[fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]
Huh?!
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
Make a decision.
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
I'm gonna answer Charles first.
There's so much more to it than that.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Rule three: Don't fall in love.
No, it's marijuana.
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
Hoist his shank on three.
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
We are going to have two men's rooms.
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
Just, write it down, please.
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Next to me?
Pam.
Angela...
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Excuse me?
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
I want an answer by tomorrow.
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
That's because they're easy!
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
Why are you looking at my forehead?
Try me.
[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on?
That's what she said! [David laughs]
What?
Here we go. Make a wish.
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
Can I drive?
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Yeah.
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
Come on!
No. [typing on keyboard]
And not come through for you?
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
I can handle that.
Now, Jim!
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
When no one hedded--
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
...confess to health care fraud.
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Stop acting like an idiot!
Stop ordering me around, Jim!
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
What... [mumbling]
I can't say [clearinng throat noise]?
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
But then no one can see us.
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
A knife.
Mm, good stuff.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Ooh, I love repartee.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Thank you Angela.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
Don't even care!
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
Like baboons or elephants.
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Are you calling me an idiot?
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Eight?
[scoffs]
No. That is not a toy.
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
Yeah...
[imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself]
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Are you socialist?
It's close.
Ok, I'll punch you.
Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
Shotgun!
Oh, no.
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Yes.
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
Really.
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
... is there any news on the leads?
Are you near sighted or far sighted?
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
It���s by the tenderloin.
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Hey, monkey, how you doing?
[seething] Holly, you approved this?
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
This is Dunder Mifflin...
Seal it off.
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
Come on. Come on.
I'm not closing the door.
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Wh--
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
Retaliation. Tit for tit.
Well, it doesn't...
[sighs]
Sly dog.
Jim.
I know you did it!
That is a demerit.
Right?
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
Yeah.
Well...
Dripping on me.
Come on!!
[scores] Yes!
If you want to tell me -
No.
Assistant regional manager.
Calm, please
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
From Jim.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
Yes. Of course.
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
DRAW SOME BLOOD!
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
My headphones are broken.
Is it called red-vining?
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Phyllis, no. No.
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
I think you���re only a teeny���
That's it.
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
Can I be your representative?
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
I told you.
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Come and get it!
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
What?
All right. Sounds good.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
What about your party?
How is he gonna have grandkids?
Okay.
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
Ohh.
Good, do you see what I'm saying?
Oh. God.
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
What?
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Not so fast.
I would remember.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
All right! What is going on here?
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Not by a long shot!
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
They really do that.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
[whispers] Oh D.
Gentlemen.
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
Are you saying you invented paper?
No.
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
It goes out automatically at five P.M.
Well...
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
--the party planning committee...
No!
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Words will never be enough.
Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
How much longer is this going to take?
Sex.
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
[holding mini-fan]  It slipped.
Ha!
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
Yeah!  Your idea.
Which is, of course���
[joins in] Shrute! Shrute!
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
Why didn't I go to business school?
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Those who can't farm, farm celery.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
I'm kneading it!
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Okay.
What's your pin number?
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Thank you.
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Michael!
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
700 and one penny.
My eyes!
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
I was born a man, Halpert.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
It���s true.
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
Right.
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Mmhmm.
Doesn't matter.
Which one's yours?
Oh, please.
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight]
Pam, hello.
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
Hello.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
Your concern is noted.
I sure do.
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
Alien
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
No. [takes a drink]
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
I am cool.
[excited] Get out! I���m a dad!
...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
I do!
I missed you Kevin.
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
Who? Dave Barry?
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
Yes.
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Yes!
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
Apparently.
Believe it.
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
They're still good for another week.
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
The bride and groom? What are their names?
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
Keep the wing flaps.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
What?
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
Michael...
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
Okay.
I am a farmer Angela.
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
That was... unauthorized.
It could be kind of funny.
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
There were. A lot of them.
Let's single...
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Okay, really?
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
That-
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
This has to do--
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Well, yeah.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
I deserve this. You know I do!
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
I...
It means ���excellent���. And we have begun.
Aaaarrhh!  [kicks over Christmas tree]
Oh I did. I did.
Drink it!
Go back to the monkey!
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
Eughh. [looks disgusted]
Was that your per diem?
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
K, I���m gonna need some help. Pam?
I need to go over some details with you.
Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
I'm coming Michael!
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
I was talking to myself.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Ok, ok.
Come on!
No, why were you in there?!
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Come on, folks!
Um, what about you?
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Should I clean out my desk?
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
Copy.
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
You're thinking of deer penis.
Good, we have a deal?
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Wait, what?
I didn't say anything
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Stupid!
Okay, you can stop.
Oh.
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Woo! Okay!
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
Hello.
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
I demand more questions!
All right, we're set.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Yeah, yeah!
Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
It just doesn't add up.
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
[creepy smile]
Very funny, Jim.
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
I can see that happening.
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Oh.
Really?
���Sedes introiti.��� Seat of entrance.
Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
I bet she had hairy armpits.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
You, you, you, you...
Uh huh.
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
[on the phone] Humor works in...
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
That's what I said.
It's my car now.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
And you will be hearing from the -
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Thanks, girl.
Ow.
Hold still, woman!
Jim!
Two at a time!
Not my urine.
Oh, Esther.
Yeah...
Oh, that's funny.
Yes... [whispers] I miss you.
It is my idea.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
No! I don't want natural!
Not! [scoffs]
All right, I'll take them.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Really funny, Michael!
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
What? Come on.
Roll in the hay, five dollars.
No, it was not!
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
She said she was only sleeping with me.
Good morning temp.
Let's get to it.
I'll make you two tapes.
That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
How ya feeling, better?
Well���no, no���n���
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Did you say Karen?
What?
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
For what purpose?
God, you're such a spy.
Let's go.
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Don���t!
No! Michael, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
Could I have a copy of one of them?
How did it go?
It did, it did.
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
[looks to Angela]
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
We're not allowed to use the baler.
Alright. [leads Michael away]
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
Michael! Michael!
He even looks like a mole.
Stay out of this, you!
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
Idiot!
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
Ryan? What does he know?
I would make sure that you were dead.
Battlestar Galatica.
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Wait, sales���what sales meeting?
Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
Oh, thank you.
I'll take that as a no.
How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
What? No, but I --
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
What's the exact square footage.
Next suggestion.
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
I volunteered for this job.
Fine.
Oh that���s real creative.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
Sure thing.
That's bad.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
People love beets.
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
Also, he slept with Pam.
Oh.
OK, this is stupid.
Welcome to our land.
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
Tent, rainfly, gorp...
No... way! Yeah!
You want rabies? Be my guest.
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
Michael.
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
Is that true?
Get out of my way. Huh!
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Oh, how did that happen?
Really?
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
You know what?
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Good morning, Michael.
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
Yeah.
Not now!
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
Excellent.
Eat it!
Hey!
So���
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
The warmth will lure people inside.
Calves. Calves all the way.
Male, age 37...
You choose!
C���mon.
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
No.
And then I inserted my penis-
What were you talking about in there?
Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
It's too small.
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
The new IT guy. Nick.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Disarm!
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Thank you.
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
What else?
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
Have you seen it?
That's really fattening.
[with conviction] Start the party.
No!
Hey buddy.
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
Wow. Late every day this week.
...is really tight.
Washington Monument.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
One...
Yes!
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
OK.
You can't just move out.
Yeah, you know me.
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
You seem suprised.
Hello, you're back.
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
You needed to speak to me?
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
Tokyo?
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Bye poochie!
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Yes.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
And how big do you want this robot?
Thanks, Michael.
Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.
Want to take a rake... .
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Based���on his merit.
Now, listen,...
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
Because you're engaged to Andy.
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
Ok, what is going on here?
Remember what we had Larry?
Aah!
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Right?
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
Ok, give that back to me.
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
Yes.
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
Yes. I am.
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
[slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
You see?
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Obesity-caused illnesses.
That means ye, Plop!
Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
...to consolidate power.
That's not good.
Get in the car.
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
I got floor.
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
I have a copy of your key.
Stop giggling.
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
You snubbed her.
Vegetarian?
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
Me too. [smirking]
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
You had black hair and then gray hair.
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Pam is down for anything.
Excuse me?
[clapping] Whoo!
I need help.
Yep.
Who is he saying?
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
How you doing, Jordan?
Wait, it���s not D.M Utica, is it?
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
Right?
What?
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
Sounds fair to me, David.
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Let's go!
So you���ll do it?
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
You're welcome.
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes.
He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Don't do anything rash!
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
Go!
Really? Oh... Then here we are.
No no no, I can't let you do this!
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]
Busy!
Torture.
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Yes.
Oh, man!
On his mother's grave.
I can make him talk, Michael.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
you said to just...
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
You speak English?
Damn It!
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Excellent idea, Pam.
I'm stronger.
One minute ago.
Make-up sex. Nice!
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
How long before?
Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
Then I will.
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
No. Angela! What are you saying?
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Come on.
I'm talking about... hmmm.
Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
Cause you���re interested in going into sales?
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
You���re welcome.
Awww!
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Well, I'm not done yet.
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
I haven't made a decision yet.
Are there any bloggers around?
Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.
Go ahead.
Made copies of it-
Normal. Ugly.
Yeah?
You���re being disrespectful!
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
What?
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Jethro Tull...
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Michael. Michael?
I thought it went great.
Please, come back.
Just trying to be helpful.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
I don't think so.
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
[laughs] Right? Come on!
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
All right.
You made a big mistake. Huge!
Daraas!
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
After you.
First present, Oscar.
Oh.
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Really?
Maybe that's how you die.
Do this. Come on. Ready?
Friends with a hobbit.
Can I use your phone?
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
No, it's not.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
And you are���
What? What's so wierd?
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Say it. Do it. Now.
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
That's an excellent analogy.
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
Nothing.
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
Where are gay mens��� vaginas?
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
Jim --
Were you absent?
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
Oh god.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Do you have the Sharpie?!
Do you have batteries?
You remember my cousin Mose.
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
Got it. Go.
The twirl sucks.
Amazons.
Thanks for inviting me along.
This. Ends. Now.
And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
Yeah!
Horse Boat.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly.
What do you have in mind?
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
What did they do to you, Angela?
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Number one!!
I know. Evel Knievel.
I���ll get my apprehension kit.
It worked.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
No, panic is warranted!
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Did I tell you about her teeth?
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
See ya later, Trevor.
Tell him to stop.
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
Good night.
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Point it towards the store, idiot!
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
[to Erin] How are the marks?
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
No word from Michael.
Very funny, Michael!
What about you?
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
I would like to arrange a truce.
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
I can't. I can't push harder!
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves]
Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
Yeah!
Hey David.
I'll do a shot, Michael.
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Yes!
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
That's a conflict of interest.
Are you really not going to punch him?
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
[running from his desk] Ayyyy!
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
What?
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
Trees!  And where do trees grow?
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
It's time.
[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?
Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
I need you to hose my aunt.
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Ok, good
Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
No thank you.
[on the phone] I understand.
And then if I want...
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
Dammit, Phyllis!
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Oh.
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Not coming, have plans.
They are now.
Not so weak, huh, Mom?
Yes, sir.
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Ah.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
OK, temp.
You know what? I made you a cd...
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Damn it!
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
No, pictures are too interpretive.
He said he would do the same for me.
Very impish.
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
[playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
That's true.
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Monkey. [kisses her]
Super 8?
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
Really shove it.
One more. To our boss!
But the little cars go in the compact spot
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
What do you say?
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
I can't let you in, Michael.
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Alright. First thing in the morning then.
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
Kelly is the only applicant.
Does it have a deck?
I'm... I was making it.
[grunts in frustration]
You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief]
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
And for���oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
Yeah.
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
It's a terrible idea.
Tell me where it hurts.
[whispers] I���d love to invest.
That would have been really embarrassing.
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
You would?
I will poison your food.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
[thinks] Interview.
I really don't think so.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
Jim, are you serious?
Observe. [walks towards desk]
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Come on.
Dry. Delicious.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
Should I get water or donuts?
But check that it's covered by your
Well ���
Talk me through an appendectomy.
Unless we're unplugged.
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Wrestle him to the ground.
He says, 'No!' Boom!
[whispering] You're gonna blow it.
Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
Okay, that is
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Answer me.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
Spoken like a true root man.
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
I am ready for my performance review.
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
Got 'em. Go!
On three. One... two... three.
Uh-huh.
Nope, I wasn't bitten.
Shh.
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Jim, what are you doing?
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Action.
[smiles knowingly]
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
You're the best.
What?
Cradle my head!
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
Great.
Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
Where did you get that mallard?
I date Indian girls.
You may have...
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Absolutely, I do. [giggles]
one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
What?
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Good evening.
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
I'm busy.
Oh, yeah. Yes!
It���s all right. Andy approved it.
What you doing?
I got a knock-knock joke.
OK, where does it hurt?
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
Kevin, not now.
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Kathy.
Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
I can handle that.
Thank you.
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
Alright.
Talk to you later, Jan.
Hey, IT guy.
It could be kind of funny.
Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
Aaaaaaaa!
No way.
[leaving] We'll bill you.
Tom?
[whispers] Coolio.
You're lying.
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
Store only has three employees.
If you fall in love with her.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
None of your business. I'm writing something.
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Let's see yours.
Please?
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
You got this kosher certified?
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Yes ma'am.
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
I know how it happened.
Just doing my job.
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Cocks in the henhouse.
Christmas card list.
It's not locked, gimme that...
No thank you.
Hmmm?
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
Okay, just shut it.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
No, there's no blood.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
Head towards the exits.
Checks out.
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
I have something to do.
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
Me.
Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
The truth.
It doesn't make any sense.
Oh... Narcolepsy.
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
That's where they remove the uterus.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
You should ask her out.
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Standing.
Get out of Jim���s seat.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
OK
Go ahead. Don't lie.
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
I can���t get it out. Try again!
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Pshh. That's a bedbug.
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
It will just take a second.
No.
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
No, impish or admirable.
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
Yes.
Excellent question.
Toby.
I didn't order anything.
If you let me run it.
I will do my voodoo.
Oh. [dumps drink out]
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
What's next?
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
I thought you guys couldn���t come.
Mi-
Where are we going?
[groans] Stop moving!
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
Damn straight.
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
What? Shirts on or off?
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
Misdemeanor?
Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
It's a miracle.
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
What's this?
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
Thank you.
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
Rhythm and blues...
Like the spirit of Christmas!
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
Just ignore him.
Really?  Anything.
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
So we're choosing...
I have to go to the hospital.
Hey Jimmy, what's up?
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
Okay.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Yes.
Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Uhh-mmm [moaning]
What is wrong with
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
Is this your car, Ryan?
I figured it would save time.
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join]
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
[hands Erin a basket of beets]
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Same old.
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
No, Pam.
What's going on in here?
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
Nope.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
She had a hysterectomy.
Do you know how to use it?
That's debatable.
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Some sort of virus?
Kevin! Doesn't apply.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Of course I checked it.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
No!
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
Yeah- oh!
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
You're an idiot.
Come -- come with me.
Are you going?
I'm a huge fan.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
Command central.
Yes, I do.
Give it a whirl.
Oh, yeah.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
You work on commission, don't you?
It is warm feelings.
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Ed was decapitated.
Let the bedbugs bite!
Thank you Sandra!
Let's get this roof going.
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Yes!
I���ll stall him. Go!
Tootenbacher.
So, all the numbers adding up?
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
He���s fine. He gets carsick really easily.
You���re not getting my clients! Nice try.
[as elevator door closes] Hold it!
I need you to perform a test.
Excellent.
Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
Great.
I will never be your vichyssoise.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Oh, no. Oh, no!
[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh]
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Uh, it's not totally empty.
You are the master.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
That's fair.
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
What's the plan?
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
You should go.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Oh, man.
No.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
Remember?
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
Oh, so glad I could help.
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
[sighs]
Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Uh-huh.
Hi Michael!
Okay.
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Oh, really? Uh-huh.
Oh come on.
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Pam.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
Yup?
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
This isn���t gonna work out.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
It means like this. [snaps fingers]
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
This is not Mega-Desk.
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
We'll be here waiting for you.
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Don't do it!
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Yes.
Good night.
K. I brought cheese too.
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!
Oh, man, it's really back there.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
Merry Christmas.
Yeah.
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Pssht.
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
My wound hasn't healed yet.
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
Go ahead, you do it.
No, it's... involves the photograph.
Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
What?
Bye Pam.
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Come on Clark!
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
Hello? Hello?
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
[to Packer] Silence.
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
How do I look?
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Yeah.
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
Come on old lady. Let's go.
Say no more.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
Hey, it's not a surprise.
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Who's doing the presentations?
You're insane.
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
The new guys called a sales meeting?
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
Aye aye, Captain.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Unlikely.
I'm breathing heavily.
Where is my desk?
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Angela, not here!
Opus dei.
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
Yeah!
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
What was your mile time?
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Wait, so you���re the boss?
No.
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
Damn it!
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
What?
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
A quilt.  Depression quilt?
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
What?
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
What did you do to it?
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
He is a goner.
I probably care more than she does.
Two forms of ID, please.
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
Okay.  Fine.
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
Shut up.
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
Exactly.
Henrietta.
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
Oh, god, this again? You���re Stinky.
He --
Yeah.
This expresses how loudly I love you.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
What's with the smile?
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
No.
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
What?
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?
Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Right...
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
The Sting. The Sting.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
What?
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Oh he's not that nice.
Yes?
With this move, he can't get you.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
No you do not.
Sounds like a plan.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Really?
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
Don't make me fire you.
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
Five minutes exactly.
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
I am trying to bring team spirit.
You got a better way?
Ok. Who reports to who?
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
Oh, yes, we do.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute.
Anything else you need to talk about?
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
Oh God.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
Please, don't.
Why just Michael?
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Please?
That is true.
[agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
This ought to be good.
No! You���re not helping, Trevor!
Oh.  Meh.
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
Oh Pam.
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Including prep time?
How many fingers am I holding up?
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
I don't understand the reference.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
It's a good market. Higher volume.
What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
What's this?
The power source.
Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
Then we meet at the Denny's...
Yes.
He totally misses,
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
Right over by that fence.
Take a bowl and pass it down.
What? Idiot.
They could do better.
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
They might be listening to us
What---
Aaah!
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Poor little fella.
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
I'm not familiar with that expression,
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Clarinet.
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
I chose my words very carefully.
What are you doing?
No!
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
[in disgust] Oh...
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
None of your business.
I don't even know what to say.
It's about Michael.
There's a photo...
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
What look?
That goes directly to the tester.
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
...their own children.
Very well.
Turn it around. Turn it around.
Where you come from, and who you are.
Recyclops will have his revenge.
No! No, no! [groans]
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
So what do we know about her?
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
$200.00
Hey, HEY.
That's impossible.
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
No.
What's going on, Michael.  Talk to me.
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Any specific animal?
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
Like those?
Ten.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
Listening.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
It's true.
Yeah.
You can't possibly be serious.
I'm not a barbarian.
Very excited?
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Oh.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
Yes, of course it does.
Okay��� Seven, one, one, nine���
Well I will prove you wrong.
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?
Yes! Ha!
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Never mind. Just never mind.
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
[talking over Jim] Okay.
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
Make way, nope, inspect me.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
And she called it nuts?
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
[loudly applauds] Yes.
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Do you mind? The men are talking.
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
How do you spell 'animalian'?
You successfully backed down the mob!
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Oh, no. What?
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
No.
Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
Well, don't look, freak!
You're twenty minutes late!
How convenient.
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
Hello, Dwight Schrute?
I can't-
Accountability booster.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
[nods to camera]
I don't know.
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
[sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases]
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
GAH!!!
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Smells like it.
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
Everybody!
By hand.
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
It's fine. What?
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
Hee-heeding this right now.
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Right.
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
That... that's impossible.
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
Ohhhhhh!
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
I, Jim Halpert...
It's a statement of fact.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
I just don't get it.
Shh. Do you hear that?
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
Why?
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
You���re not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
Michael?
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
Impossible.
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
What?
Let���s get him inside.
That's right.
Dwight Schrute.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
We thought that she was you.
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
Yes.
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
It's pony.
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Yeah.
You okay, Robert?
Ready? What do you think?
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
Wait, canine AIDS?
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
Would that be such a bad thing?
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
What do you think history is?
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
We have more houses to visit.
Are you kidding me?
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
You don't know?
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
I want to do this.
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.
Wha...
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Take a stand!
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
I'll stay for ten.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
I think I saw it!
Thanks old man.
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
[coughs]
Sure. That'd be fine.
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
What?
Really?
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
What?
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
And their king bee.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Really?
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
And 'Breaking Corporate News.'
That's what she said.
It is my duty...
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
He used to fight dogs.
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
Damn it!
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
300 and one penny.
No thanks.
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Yes.
We measured it once...
Definitely.
I am not a liar.
All we can do is sit and wait.
[salutes] Thank you, Michael.
To socialize.  And inform.
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
I've only had to use it once.
I'm peeing in this empty can.
Only one way to find out.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
He defecated, aw.
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
Sign it.
I do!  I want some man meat!
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
Fine, let���s go. [grunts]
You just said it. You just said it.
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
There's one more suggestion.
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Right. Highways or surface roads?
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
I could never do that!
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
I'm thirsty!
Erin....the receptionist!
Psst.
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
That's a total waste of your 'M.'
Ahh!
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
Lock your door!
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Come on in, the water���s fine.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Have you finished with the sketch?
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
When is the guest of honor coming?
Pam...
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
You most certainly did not.
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
