Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
The bride and groom? What are their names?
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
You can't steal what is legally your property.
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
Are you really not going to punch him?
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
I think I cut my penis on the lid!

Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
I thought he was out on the road.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
It is the situation that we are in now.
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
We are going to have two men's rooms.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
All their top clients I can't believe it.
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
Is that how they like to get in?
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
I wish I could hire all of you.
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
You just said it. You just said it.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
I can tell. I won't let you down.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
This is war and that is what happens.
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
No no no, I can't let you do this!
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
I need to go over some details with you.
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
You've done more then you can possibly know.
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
And you will be hearing from the -
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
I love finding a good set of twins.
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Does he have access to their medical records?
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
All we can do is sit and wait.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
I have to put you on with my boss.
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
If you say screw you one more time...
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
I would make sure that you were dead.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
You had black hair and then gray hair.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
I know. I know exactly what to do.
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
You know what? I made you a cd...
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
You need to do something about your B.O.
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
I will stay here and run things on this end.
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
Where you come from, and who you are.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Who was the second man on the moon?
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
What are some of your small business ideas?
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
All you have to do it say it.
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
There's so much more to it than that.
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
I can see that as a very real possibility.
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
And how big do you want this robot?
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Do you live in a regular sized house?
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
No need we can just check the security tapes.
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Do you want to do this right or not?
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
They are either going to say yes... or no.
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
I will trade you for the used candle.
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
And you want me to come with you.
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
I put everything back in the vending machine.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
And he made us all look like chumps!
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
How much longer is this going to take?
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
Don't make me do this the hard way.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
So what do you need me to do?
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
Why would Michael give you one before me?
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
How dare you all attack him like this.
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
So who will be your new Number Three?
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
You said you didn't know how to say it.
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
...because you are never going to see him again.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
Is that the last year the data was available?
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
This is where I saw that deer last week.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
I never said it was better than an iPod.
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
How long has he been in the bathroom?
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
Could I have a copy of one of them?
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
It would be better if you were unconscious.
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
He said he would do the same for me.
I have to do something to his eyes.
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
... is there any news on the leads?
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
She said she was only sleeping with me.
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
You know there's a ghost in this office
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
But the little cars go in the compact spot
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
